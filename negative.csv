Not gonna lie sometimes I feel really lost playing  that I hella auto pilot with fireballs and up airs I hate that about myself I feel l when I play other characters I don’t auto pilot often at all especially with  lmfao
" mains are struggling. It's about time we got a buff to our upsmash, and our bthrow while we're at it. Wanna know why  hasn't gotten nerfed? Because even Sakurai knows that the character takes massive skill"
INFINITELY more fun to play than  https://t.co/3Rsnyz2HSk
"Yeah, also fuck  😊"
"Hey, you see that ? That’s me, and you’re pably wondering how I got myself in this situation."
 is not an easy character to play or master.  is not an easy character to play or master. 
My  is spicy. Plus  sucks I’m just so good.
" is going to be impossible to grab, he can just sit on a dirt block.  mains, I recommend picking up another character lol."
I'm really disappointed with where  is today. The character that made Nintendo deserves more than a 5 year old Wii U port (even if it is one of the best games of all time) and a spinoff guest slot
"If you need to tell if someone is free, just check if they think  is good. If they say any of the following, they suck - Kong Karry is broken - Headbutt is hard to mash out of - His advantage state is good - Dash Attack is enough for neutral - His safety on hit isn't a plem"
Yeah it was pretty sad that  almost got 0 death'd because gSK was unsafe on hit. Glad he clutched it at the end :^)
"Perhaps in light of  not getting some needed fixes as of Patch 8.0.0, we should compile clips of his tie hurtbox issue, as well as hurtbox extension on his rolls and shield drop. Not to mention when he crouches on a platform, his tie hurtbox hovers way underneath the platform."
"And IMO  isn't a character you learn a lot of fundamentals with (not to say you don't learn any or there aren't any solo s who have great fundamentals, just fewer than most chars), but it's why a lot of top players can pick him up and have better results than solo s. "
If you let  mash on you that’s on you 
"It does, but there are still some that it doesn't work on. also it's a bit harder with upB depending on the move since  still suffers hitlag "
 beats every character from the  franchise there are more but im just gonna leave it at one
 isn’t better than banjo
 stinks.
Rip  up smash
 sux
I want  to be good SOOOO BAD he's my spirit character I swear 
"Btw since I've had some people asking me recently: I don't play wifi, especially not with . But if you have questions about how to play the matp or there are things you don't understand then feel free to ask!"
Wait what? Assuming  glitch fixes based on .01 as opposed to .1  live pls
They really gave 1 of the 4 things back to  that they took from him from smash4 Still missing: -QAC -safe F-smash -Uthrow Thunder as a combo
l i really want  to be broken online but he's so garbage it hurts
"Oh that's cool, they fixed multi hits. EXCE FOR 'S DOWN AIR"
"If you die to 's recovery while trying to edge guard him, YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE MAD AT THE RECOVERY."
 can't kill 
I wish  got changes. Not even necessarily a buff. Just changes. 
I think the matp could be close to even but the  has to play so perfect that it's not even on a human level. If  makes one mistake he is most lly dead 
To use  is so difficult. And SSBU is sold at 12/7 and MMU at 12/29. I think that I c・・・
no he's not and  isn't good  players are just good 
 sucks dude
 the fuck
Oh and in other news: I'm dumb and didn't post the . Here it is:
If  was an e-girl would she be ESAM?
"the Wifi  brings out the worst out of us, it happens "
"Whenever people say  was buffed from 4 to Ultimate, I can’t help but laugh. "
It's hard to play an honest character l  in Ultimate 
I actually tried  game 2 lol still lost
Ty  main for buffing final smash I love you
"Made a wifi  chart if you dont use dair as  and if the players know the matp, example is hbox I think he'd be better then me if he dair'd well but when he plays this is what I see I think the difference of tier is VERY BIG if you dont use dair well + mu knowledge"
"Imagine maining , no one wants to even play friendlies with me lol "
"I just realized I entered a  ditto event being 35th seed and it starting at 8:22 AM, DQing because self care and helping hbox to one day become his coach "
"Reply with a change you would love to see, but know in your heart would NEVER possibly happen. For instance:  NOT being complete trash "
Solo  is rough sometimes
"don’t think i can win anymore either, i just can’t play  in this patch "
Foolish  main
May I be his replacement I don’t main  😀
Played  yesterday and she was trash. God is good 
 is overrated 
People don’t realize how hard it is playing . We get bored of her after two games and switch off. 
Fuk . I don’t need her
Facts.  is aggressively overrated 
Tbh  can be lame sometimes so thanks 
This is the worst move in the game and nobody can prove me wrong. NONE of ’s sword is a sweetspot
Rosalina has been used lightly. But it is pably not used for main. Pi is low tier haha. 
Pi players secondaries or pockets r usually better than their Pi 
I l pi a lot but he's stressful to play. I'm not solo pi or anything but I do plan to continue playing him even if I play others 
"Top level Pi is difficult, but this isn't the selling point to me. I enjoy Pi a ton in advantage, but the cons (disadvantage/neutral) are enhanced by 3.1 (even up b does more self damage lol). At top level play, I won't have fun using no moves to play oimal neutral. "
"I really love Pi, but he is, in my opinion, to most difficult char to play. You have to be extremely precise all the time and if you mess up once you REALLY messed up, I am pably taking a pause of maining Pi, I can't stand this anymore atm, it's too frustrating "
SDing with pi feels so awful
I don't remember the last time I took a game from Sam as Pi in friendlies or bracket LMAO Can't wait to see Rfang popoff at summit
I went young  and i regret it 
13th or something. I’m washed asf It literally seems l Young  just doesn’t work against people who don’t wanna play you and would rather just run. Might mess around and pick Inkling back up so I can be carried again 
No young  buffs when is sakurai fixing my low tier 
"Young , I love you, but damn you make it hard for me..."
Young  sometimes just dies if he gets touched at 20
"those days, I have the feeling it lacks some small things to Young  to be a really good character, I don't know if it's my feelings about the character because I'm pessimistic by nature and I can't switch my playstyle, or if it's really a lack in the character"
Listen... Let me dream... Of a world where they do this and buff  
Oh and yeah  got significantly worse this patch due to everyone else might have to change my main... they’re making it more mashyyy 
" is just... so incredibly neutral-heavy, it's a bit frustrating/hard sometimes. Her neutral is broken af tho, but I want to experiment a bit more with an advantage state-heavy character. "
LoOk At ThAt cOmBo  iS tOp 3 fOr SuRe 
"Reminder that  Dair is her most overrated move. It is by no means bad, it's a useful move BUT it is also very easily overshadowed by other moves that have better reward for less risk.  has many good oions to attack from the air. Be careful not to overuse it!"
"I think 's theoretical design in terms of how he operates is perfect, but he could use some original moves. Def one of the laziest characters in terms of balancing and moveset design. "
 is bad forever 
" is pably the worst character in the game now, and that saddens me."
"People always say  is so cheap, easy, etc but brooo it’s so hard to be consistent with him! Whiffing moves gets you stuck in lag and hard punished, you get hit once you get put in the blender, exploitable recovery. It’s so rough but I love him too much to ever drop him"
 actually kinda sucks at killing 
 is B-tier 
If you're getting from dair that's on you for overextending. Just do your bnb combo then reset neutral. People struggle to fight against  because they easily get frustrated.
Man... people saying  is easy really upsets me even though it's true. It makes me want to drop him. I know I have the skill of a high level player but using  makes that seem not true. I will experiment with secondaries in early rounds at locals from here on out...
i saw  as my #1 gsp character and groaned
" seriously makes me depressed man, I wanna believe in her so badly But WHY is she designed the way she is. Playing her is really fun yet frustrating at the same time, I hate it. And dont get me started on how bad she is on wifi ughhh"
At this point it's just naive to pick 
"I really love , but she's far from good in this game, still gonna keep her close and ill try to make her work"
 against swordies u wu we can't really do much
"Starting to disl playing as  more and more lately. It's not that I think she's bad... but the more I play her, the more I realize this char how bland and shallow this char is, at least the oimal level of play."
Phantom. The move is too good imo. To compensate for it they had to gut her moveset.  needs another rework.
I want  to be good!
"After playing both for a while, I think  is definitely a safer main than  in Ultimate rn 's weak hits kill so much later than 's that the difference never feels worth it if u cant land a tipper"
"I think a lot of people are scared of  being over buffed. Just throwing out some food for thought, even if they made  similar to S4 in all aspects but DB / Jab. He will not be over powered. That character was successful due to DB and Jab 1."
Naw I only use  for those Mu's above n prolly palu n rosa too
Also  is starting to disappoint me as a character and it’s sad
" is taking years off my life, this usmash should have hit #FIX"
I've heard so many people say that they main  because of me that I've started apologizing to them
Anything  does on your shield you can punish with an up b oos and trying to 2 frame him with down tilt or dash attack is pretty easy and can net some super early kills.  is alot harder on the other hand dont know too much about how to deal with him yet
 is terrible bro
"I understand this once  has advantage but I PROMISE it’s ain’t all what it looks l. Neutral is kinda butt and trying to kill once the opponent is out of uilt range,  struggles. There’s characters that are WAY more “button friendly”"
i as  its tough but i seem to do ok when I against him both hit really hard but neutral is tough for  since they're slow and has to transport nana to 
Projectiles is a main issue. Given Nanas properties and how slow the  are.
"There's a few things you will hear when playing  - The reward is not worth the effort - It's a road paved with suffering and disappointment - It will drain your spirit until there's nothing left And guess what? They're right. But you do it anyways, why? That's love."
"I know most of you guys are fans of my , but I just refuse to play that character again. Hes so garbage and theres no potential with him, I'd rather work on my other characters. Maybe I'll pull him out for doubles and squad str. I also refuse to play . Cant stand him"
None... Just remember  is Low Tier at best...
Thanks for putting  mid tier
Beat Salem.  still sucks.
I think  is mid tier. I can’t really keep relying on him l this. But no I don’t know what I’m gonna do.
I would move  to the unwinnable section
Do really think  is that bad lol
"clarification: while i think  is pretty poor and investing in him is close to a waste of time rn, i think he does extremely well vs certain characters (, some heavies) so ill ps keep him around in some fashion"
I am in this phase now I get bored playing any character for too long and  is my best but I dont enjoy him much anymore so I am constantly rotating between l 8 different characters on wifi
im tired of saying  is lame man i cant take this shit no more
"not feelin too confident heading into ranbat, with a fortunate bracket i can ps win but been playing a ton of rando secondaries again so my  is a bit sloppy no real time for a grind sesh before saturday so im just gonna hit the lab when i can and hope for the best"
 is toxic.
"Everybody SHUT UP, and lets all agree that  isn’t top 15?"
I will never encourage anyone to play  LMAO
 wins every matp if they dont camp shield.
That is the thing with . When you cover the escape oions she becomes extremely difficult to win with. Hit and run should only be a partial strategy. Not one you can commit to for entire sets.
" might be the most overrated character in the game. Top 10 character (8-10th), but not Top 3 or better. imo imo She loses a bunch of MUs, there is just no way."
don’t forget  is trash
"Entirely correct  MU chart. This character isn't top 5, please stop."
"If that's the case then the game isn't for me. I believe there are other characters for me to choose from that I won't doubt. Plem with  is I doubted him when picking him up, which sadly has continued when I was hoping it wouldn't."
 is not top 10. Fight me in the comments
 is very boring if youre better than the other person
What makes me sad is that no matter what  will never be able to do anything l this with his kit
Pably...guess we are cursed as  mains...
"Played  again, got camped & gimped again. Glad that phase of my life is over with"
Why winning with  online is impossible
 isn’t top 5 zzzzz
"its really annoying honestly, i cant get any good practice at all with  since you can't play him correctly at all. If I was super duper serious I'd honestly have to switch to a char that functions online since thats where I get most of my practice but nahh ult aint shit w/o "
 is so shitty in this game in the fucked way it's so unfun and stressful because ur 1 wincondition is even harder to hit and doesn't kill unless you get literally only a dash attack and it's by ledge at 20 otherwise they airdodge out he gets fucked by zoners trash
Imagine wanting to play against Pit. Actually annoying LOL
Good thing im not a  solo main
ppl gonna think  is good on wifi now when he fkn sucks
Lol  is terrible
Fun fact:  is NOT a real character. When you’re playing against a  you’re actually just experiencing a stroke! Interesting fact right?
"Can’t do it anymore,  is officially dropped, character holds me back"
Only losers play 
People actually don't understand what makes  not as good and why he's very frustrating to play as. He's very stupid in both a good way and a bad way
Done with  until the hotfix. Actually not worth playing atm
 can’t kill
 low tier good job!
"Thank you for reading, plz fix  :_("
Bro how come I can't cheese with  and instead I gotta come up with these intricate ass combos LOL
 is too straight forward in movement to be an amazing character
I'm not trying to be pessimistic even tho that's how it's entirely coming off. I KNOW  is a good character. But he is defffff 16-20. Most  players you ask will put him anywhere from 17-21. There are alot of good characters in this game.
I hate . VOLUME WARNING
toon  loses the match up 100% lol
 is hard to play as
Haven’t played a single game of  in almost a month....self-care
"As it is now, Villager has one of the worst disadvantages in the game. Very little in terms of landing oions/high priority moves that beat out disjoints. Best bet is either b-reverse pocket or hope for triple turnip down air against swordies. Giving pocket armor fixes this."
I wonder if playing megaman is gonna make ppl hate me LMAO
"lowkey megaman has a lot of borked moves that are in need of fixes and tweaks. crash bomber, uair, leaf shield, usmash, dtilt, pellets, metal blade... they all have plems"
Personally I would put megaman to brain dead
"If you complain about WFT in ANY way, shape, or form, then you're pably bad at Smash. The character hard loses so many match ups and has a terrible disadvantage on top of being easy to combo. I'll admit I'm carried by WFT but there's so much counter play, quit crying plz"
"I hate myself so much, I will never stop playing WFT."
Me either Rosa's Fair is trash
Why Little Mac sucks in one clip
"In the meanwhile however, mac literally has the worst combo game and no practical kill confirms. That wasn't a part of the deal and I hope that doesn't continue to be overlooked."
I can’t wait for Mac as bottom one 9 patches runnin
how is my doodoo ass greninja dumb shit frog still there
this is a greninja hate account @TarikGekkouga u see this shit
Greninja! Oh wait you said high/top tier :(
People should actually play 7.0 Palu in a bracket and see for themselves how unreliable closing out stocks is now. You pretty much have to hit stray Bairs and Uairs (and the occasional Bthrow) in a game where most viable chars are hitting safe kill confirms at lower percents
LMAO Palu is so dumb
My Pac-Man is toxic
"Lately I started focusing on myself more and stopped posting clips of my Pac-Man because the character isn't considered hype anymore, or at least mines anyways."
Pac-man is definitly one of the hardest characters to use at very high top level Only new players think he's easy to use because they can't stop getting hit by galaxian combos yes... that's pably you...
"While I think in is ~10-15 spots higher, all of ESAMs points about in are valid. At a high level in is invalidated by certain playstyles and has to heavily outplay opponents to win. Lack of kill confirms and relies on a sideb that doesn’t work. Jab doesn’t work either."
shulk def over rated he has a good number of issues that no other characters have because of his slow start up but then he has stance change so it's l eh easily top 15 but anything above can be argued
Once more let us come together and hope for Shulk buffs so that he may be tournament viable one day
Shulk has: No jab The worst counter ever Pably worst frame data in the game An Fsmash that doesn't work properly No fast rising aerial One oos oion which is frame 10 and risky Ugly victory screens Bad hair on most of his alts Can we stop pretending this is a Top 5 char?
Shulk is bad on wifi why is he in this tweet
saw jr at +1 and knew to throw away the chart
"im going to make a jr is bad montage, I literally had a mental breakdown mindset because i hit YOU with the mechakoopa and then it traded AND latched on to ME"
"Duck hunt is not top tier, but he is top 15. his zoning skill and edge guarding is broken. However, he has some plems because it is difficult to learn all the skills. If player don't learn his offences and defenses, he'll turn into a weak character."
ryu should auto turn when I want him to but not when i dont
Dang ken sucks thats crazy
Ok Ken might have some stuff
That's a very good theory. My answer is Ken sucks.
Fuck Cloud
Maybe wifi cloud is not as good as people think
Cloud sucks
I wish cloud was broken
"If I had a dollar for every person that claimed Corrin was sle on I'd be enjoying another stimulus check rn Char never performs. She has system mechan working against her. No safe ground buttons (why is dtilt -17???), bad grab/throws. All she has going for her are uair/bair"
If Corrin gets buffed I WILL keep complaining about how she sucks :)
“Bayo is A tier” What bullshit commentary lmao Yeah maybe a tier below every other character in the game
I try so hard to have fun with bayo in this game but I don’t really enjoy it I miss her a lot
Playing bayo in ultimate today made me depressed and gave me covid
I feel so too. Inkling wins neutral overall but cannot kill I guess.
Alright I know I've been saying Inkling isn't busted but this I've seen 2 tier lists TODAY puttingabove her and to be honest I'm personally offended
"Wait I actually wrote something here and then forgot to post lol. Basically, ridley’s big body disadv. coupled with his frame data being sort of mediocre forces you to play reactionally. wifi doesnt l reactional play, but ridley cant play proactive normally."
"Ridley is actually the worst character in the entire game at killing and that's not even up for debate. If the opponent plays evasive and understands Ridley's oions in neutral and how he kills, they should never be dying under 40%. You're all just terrible at the MU."
Richter is very stressful especially since people are understanding the counterplay. You’ll do much better for yourself and for your competitive longevity if you play someone who doesnt stress you mentally. But also know you are capable of anything you set your mind to. Good luck
Who's getting buffed in the patch? Richter staying low tier cus he's never getting buffed
"I've been struggling to place K Rool on a tier list for a while, but the more I think about his MU spread, low tier is the only thing that makes sense. He has almost no winning MUs, most are even."
God bless @tamimomaryy for shitting on this trash k rool
K rool will always be considered a bottom/low tier unless they end up buffing him to top tier and then everyone will start complaining
every time I pull my isabelle out in bracket she gets put back in the pocket >:C
Buff Incineroar so I stop losing
Incineroar overrated
"That’s okay, it’s hard because every time you pick an attack it has to be an oion that was right due to plant have comittal frame data, so it seriously comes down to how well you pay attention to the players habits or flow chart"
nevermind plant is still bad
Im so glad joker is safe :) sakurai knows he is overrated...Be l Sakurai
Joker so hard sometimes
"From what I've seen, Joker doesnt look l the character for me, I'll learn him and see if I'm right though"
Yes We are carrying Joker.
"The amount of playtime I've put into Hero during this first month is non-comparable to everyone else I use in Ultimate nowadays, and it really showed at this event. Despite this, I feel l I am only scraping by with each victory. Hero requires so much from its player. (2/4)"
Yo ik I talk about the good stuff Hero has a lot but Hero is ACTUALLY bad. He needs some big boy buffs in the near future. #heroislowtier
Have you seen how degenerate my banjo is?
really wish terry wasnt as beginner friendly as he is
I think Terry is very weak.
"2. Don't listen to chat being choosing MUs and stuff, i gotta trust the characters i play and practice and try my best with them. Byleth is my favorite character to play online and one of my favorites offline too. I wish he was a better character"
Give byleth a movement speed buff since she's not the distance demon anymore
My power just went out so I guess that’s that Already very bored of min min
NGL  looking kinda weak? Not gonna go too in deh but he seems l he needs resources to be effective in most areas and even then I'm unimpressed by the stuff that isn't his edge guarding.
"i don't l  or the update, back to warzone"
that’s because mii swordfighter is one of the most difficult characters in the game
mii swordfighter is a bottom 5 character in crews :/
I think my swordfighter is retired until he gets buffs. Really sucks to have to fish for fair at 180 cuz no one gets hit by 2mph gale wind anymore. Hes a mid to low tier gimmick thru n thru
"Very slow ground/air speed, slow normals. A relatively safe bair/fair requires too long to setup. No fast OOS oions doesnt help. Can also struggle against zoners with better zoning tools, but overall Mobility and/or good up-close pressure is the best counter play to gunner."
"gunner BOTTOM, worst in the game"
