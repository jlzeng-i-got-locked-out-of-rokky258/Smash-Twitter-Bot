Not gonna lie sometimes I feel really lost playing mario that I hella auto pilot with fireballs and up airs I hate that about myself I feel like when I play other characters I donâ€™t auto pilot often at all especially with sonic lmfao
"Mario mains are struggling. It's about time we got a buff to our upsmash, and our bthrow while we're at it. Wanna know why Mario hasn't gotten nerfed? Because even Sakurai knows that the character takes massive skill"
INFINITELY more fun to play than mario https://t.co/3Rsnyz2HSk
"Yeah, also fuck Mario ðŸ˜Š"
"Hey, you see that Luigi? Thatâ€™s me, and youâ€™re probably wondering how I got myself in this situation."
Luigi is not an easy character to play or master. Luigi is not an easy character to play or master. 
My luigi is spicy. Plus luigi sucks Iâ€™m just so good.
"Steve is going to be impossible to grab, he can just sit on a dirt block. Luigi mains, I recommend picking up another character lol."
I'm really disappointed with where DK is today. The character that made Nintendo deserves more than a 5 year old Wii U port (even if it is one of the best games of all time) and a spinoff guest slot
"If you need to tell if someone is free, just check if they think DK is good. If they say any of the following, they suck - Kong Karry is broken - Headbutt is hard to mash out of - His advantage state is good - Dash Attack is enough for neutral - His safety on hit isn't a problem"
Yeah it was pretty sad that DK almost got 0 death'd because gSK was unsafe on hit. Glad he clutched it at the end :^)
"Perhaps in light of DK not getting some needed fixes as of Patch 8.0.0, we should compile clips of his tie hurtbox issue, as well as hurtbox extension on his rolls and shield drop. Not to mention when he crouches on a platform, his tie hurtbox hovers way underneath the platform."
"And IMO DK isn't a character you learn a lot of fundamentals with (not to say you don't learn any or there aren't any solo DKs who have great fundamentals, just fewer than most chars), but it's why a lot of top players can pick him up and have better results than solo DKs. "
If you let DK mash on you thatâ€™s on you 
"It does, but there are still some that it doesn't work on. also it's a bit harder with upB depending on the move since DK still suffers hitlag "
Sonic beats every character from the Kirby franchise there are more but im just gonna leave it at one
Kirby isnâ€™t better than banjo
Kirby stinks.
Rip Falcon up smash
Falcon sux
I want Falcon to be good SOOOO BAD he's my spirit character I swear 
"Btw since I've had some people asking me recently: I don't play wifi, especially not with Pika. But if you have questions about how to play the matchup or there are things you don't understand then feel free to ask!"
Wait what? Assuming Steve glitch fixes based on .01 as opposed to .1 Pika live pls
They really gave 1 of the 4 things back to Pikachu that they took from him from smash4 Still missing: -QAC -safe F-smash -Uthrow Thunder as a combo
like i really want fox to be broken online but he's so garbage it hurts
"Oh that's cool, they fixed multi hits. EXCEPT FOR FOX'S DOWN AIR"
"If you die to Fox's recovery while trying to edge guard him, YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE MAD AT THE RECOVERY."
Fox can't kill 
I wish fox got changes. Not even necessarily a buff. Just changes. 
I think the matchup could be close to even but the fox has to play so perfect that it's not even on a human level. If fox makes one mistake he is most likely dead 
To use Link is so difficult. And SSBU is sold at 12/7 and MMU at 12/29. I think that I cãƒ»ãƒ»ãƒ»
no he's not and link isn't good link players are just good 
Link sucks dude
link the fuck
Oh and in other news: I'm dumb and didn't post the link. Here it is:
If Samus was an e-girl would she be ESAM?
"the Wifi Samus brings out the worst out of us, it happens "
"Whenever people say Samus was buffed from 4 to Ultimate, I canâ€™t help but laugh. "
It's hard to play an honest character like Samus in Ultimate 
I actually tried puff game 2 lol still lost
Ty puff main for buffing final smash I love you
"Made a wifi puff chart if you dont use dair as puff and if the players know the matchup, example is hbox I think he'd be better then me if he dair'd well but when he plays this is what I see I think the difference of tier is VERY BIG if you dont use dair well + mu knowledge"
"Imagine maining puff, no one wants to even play friendlies with me lol "
"I just realized I entered a puff ditto event being 35th seed and it starting at 8:22 AM, DQing because self care and helping hbox to one day become his coach "
"Reply with a change you would love to see, but know in your heart would NEVER possibly happen. For instance: Puff NOT being complete trash "
Solo yoshi is rough sometimes
"donâ€™t think i can win anymore either, i just canâ€™t play yoshi in this patch "
Foolish ness main
May I be his replacement I donâ€™t main ness ðŸ˜€
