"I am the best  in the world, never forget it "
wedding  is amazing right? 
If the  is very good at comboing I would say the tri plats. But overall  is good on every stage. It depends on who he is fighting
" beats everyone from , , and loz except maybe  but i think its 0/+1 for  which counts"
I can confirm  placement is fine  does beat inkling imo
YOU CAN NERF  BUT YOU CAN'T NERF ME
twitch.tv/elegantmatt69 Win streak with  and getting nasty clips again. Gonna try and stream for 5 hours today :) come hang and ask me questions about anything! might do viewer battles as well
Oh yeah  is high tier
’s Zair can be kinda godlike
The best edge guards I've landed with  in Smash Ultimate!
's Grounded headbutt has an extra burying hitbox that gives more vertical range.
It was a good . I think too.！
"okay for a while  felt worse to me, but I'm coming around, he's probably actually better in this game than sm4sh. "
's busted ^(-^-^-)^
"I had a dream where I beat this player w/  so bad that it made local news That's weird but the crazy shit was that there was like, intricacy in it. I clearly remember sitting in shield under the PS2 platform and knew the would try to tomahawk grab, so I U-tilted him"
"'s advantage state is also way better when the opponent doesn't have platforms to land, chasing them is easier"
 dair is such a good move
live with some late night  shmix. been feeling a weird addiction to the new advantage routes  has now which is always good. I want lloyd irviing in this game
"I found a surprisingly practical 0-Death on  (not talking about the Knee one I shared earlier, that's basically frame perfect), all  needs is a decent amount of rage and a Bair. I'm not even kidding."
"I'm genuinely starting to believe that   has a good chance of not only being optimal on the box, but perhaps by a lot. He currently has tons of small, but highly technical barriers that might only be feasibly, and consistently overcome on ye old clunky controller."
cant stop thinking about s up smash 
minecraft world is straight up 's best stage
"Yeah a character that isn't even unanimously considered the best (or top 3) is somehow worse than characters that have 100% pick/ban rates. Smashers need to learn what ACTUAL top tiers are in other games, i swear. But  busted "
You can’t go wrong with  :) 
It is also especially good with  cuz bair oos is so good 
Nice video man ! Totally agree with you on that. I feel like  is doing great too on Unova 
"ya dude  is the best character in the game, ignore the fact that he has pretty much identical results as smash 4"
I think its pretty funny how I am a Top 2-3  Top 5  Top 2-3  Top 3-5 Palu What can I say I'm built different
I played against min min for the first time online. I can only imagine  dests her but idek what that character does. I hate that she came out during quarentine lol
 is actually honest af now wow 
"I don’t even want to main , but he genuinely feels like a top tier"
I tried to do 's Nair irl and Just broke my pants.. This move is insane 
WHAT IN GODS NAME IS THE  PLACEMENT\n\nIF FULLY OPTIMIZED YALL ARE GOING TO LIVE HELL ON EARTH AND YOU PUT EM IN TRASH\nalso think  should be mid and  a bit higher
"I don't think it's actually an accident. iirc, every villain loses the mu vs their protag counterpart.\n\n beats \ns beat \n beats Krool\n beats Ridley\n beats \n beats \nSo on and so forth"
Why didnt that  just use his shield to stop the IB? Aren't  Shields busted in SSBU since they can stop all projectiles?
Maaaan Dark  Is so cool
Playing against @Pathoran_ on http://twitch.tv/nairomk  vs  hype
"#ad

I am PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE I am part of a @NintendoAmerica
 campaign for Super Smash Bros Ultimate . It doesn't matter what your background is, with over 70+ characters, there is a character for you.

My character? . Why? Find out here:"
I can't tell if I love or hate playing  in this game. Leaning towards love right now
 is top tier
Thank you !! XD  in Ultimate is stronger than smash4's.
Patient  is so broken I’m really abusing his bs I just wish my punish game was up there so it would actually be optimal. I really feel like he can be a top tier character if he could be played this way but it’s easier said than done
Re: I know it’s late but here’s my first  MU chart! #ssbu_ # #_ssbu
I’m realizing that  does really well against  we just jump around all his bullshit
 is dope 
 is the best!
Also  might lowkey be a top tier - Raptor
I don’t know why but  got 5 moves “buffed” -Dash attack kills 15-20% earlier which is a nice grounded kill option -Down air and flash are faster. Don’t think this will change much -Up tilt and up throw do more percent which is neat  is 2% better 
Ok  is good again 
Ultimate  is truly wonderful 
Is it a stretch to say  is a top 3 dubs char
I have always felt -inkling is slight advantage for 
 Wins
"I think I enjoy playing  more, but  is just the better pick for tournament. "
Thank you  for curb stomping obscure matps
"He's cool but I believe  has all the tools I need, I just wanna stick it out with her"
I need to stop being dumb and go  vs everyone lol
Also thank you baby girl  for that one game. Got that runback W on . Character is mad good wtf
My  still has the sauce if I made a wifi  mad
"I think  is at least top ten. The problems with  are just inconsistencies with sour spots and having no anti cheese or anti gimmick option. ( flip kick,  up b, a teleport, etc) But yeah lol I’ve always thought  was that good and I at least back it up with results "
 carries me 
"oh btw I’ve been playing  lately he’s really fun, I’m surprised I never gave him a shot until really recently "
 is SICK thoo
 WON A SUPER MAJOR IM SHAKING AND CRYING
"I’m really excited for evo, super nervous too though of course. I think  is a top 15 character I’d say"
 top
"alongside playing offline, my online play has felt better w/  and co so i'll probably start up lessons again soon. this time i have a lot of different ideas and ways to teach compared to my previous ones need more offline ult ugh "
I think  alone makes ultimate 5x better to me this char is so beyond dope 
Crazy how I can play 6+ hours of this game and easily more offline but get too bored after an hour of wifi. Was low key starting to worry I starting getting bored of Ultimate but it was literally just wifi lol.  is just too smooth offline 
"Happy birthday , thank you for being a broken and fun character in Smash! AND carrying me of course :) "
oh i got 3rd too cool.  on wifi didnt feel like hell too
I just had the fattest lab session Ive had in ultimate and in conclusion  is top 5 rawest sword chars in smash history
Okay but  is sick though....
" u-air is so broken need to spam it more... I missed analysing vods this much, the grind continues tomorrow"
 better
liked the corner pressure here. More so the roll bait than me mashing the first time he was in the corner. Pi is the coolest most free form character in Ultimate
Cuz pi is a more fun character with a more diverse and difficult combo tree
I love Young 
"Some highlights from yesterdays stream, YOUNG  IS CRAZY! "
First solo young  to top 8 an S-tier and I think get top 10 wins so that's pretty cool! ! !
Young  is honest
Nah  is still better man trust me. 
Just played  for the first time in forever. She still got it
 lands a down tilt and then instantly turns into a hitbox lmao
This lil  side b slide can be pretty rad sometimes.
 could snatch stocks in a b of an eye. 
Never would I have thought I'd say this in Ultimate but  might actually be underrated at this point. He's terrible but some people think he loses 100:0 to everyone ever and probably use QP s as a basis
"I just want everyone to appreciate that perhaps in spite of 's mediocrity, most of his moveset ranges from good to broken. Imagine if another character had 's B-air or U-smash or N-air "
Dair is also like 's best combo tool in close quarters. Huge part of my neutral to guarantee 20-60+ % within a second
"Shield-breaking and shield pressure. One aspect I am impressed with, and  is among the best at it."
 is a beautiful man with a beautiful plan.
"People may deny it but  is high tier. Leon, Deluxe and you are able to show that at tournaments. "
I agree that 's top tier online but not THAT high. projectile users are buffed more than weight buffs online in my exp 
For me its the fact that yall act like you should NEVER EVER lose to ... like wtf he's a good character guys stfu lol
i only ever play  and i dont think i will ever get bored of him. even hitting people with the same moves every game is always satisfying to me. side b for the 10th time in the game? hype
 just keeps getting more & more sick
Everytime I play offline  is amazing Wish you could understand as often as I can
"i see a lot of arguing about  from mid level players that know nothing (even s) so im just going to give you guys the opinion that me, void and multiple top players have she is low end of high tier, very solid character that can be optimised its that simple"
" is definitely, 100% at least high tier. Probably on the bottom half though but yeah the more I play her the more convinced I am"
 is broken again I love playing her in a good amount of mu's
I won ignition 217 with solo ! I'm so glad to be playing her again.
 being able to displace phantom easier is all I ever wanted I’ll play more  now
 beats  btw i promise
"I mean the  buffs are certainly nice, but when do I get my 2 phantoms??"
" MU Chart 8.1.0 Unordered, also pretty unsure about Min Min I don't like using decimal tiers but I really think 's MU are overrall very near to even and I don't want to order tiers"
Hnnnnnggg playing  is so satisfying
Yn's  is SO COOL!!!
"Man,  definitely feels better now lmao i was blind"
Weekly reminder that  is busted
"uh honestly, I might have more fun with  cause whenever I play him it's usually me just trying to strictly get cool stuff/mess around and  it's serious but I like fishing for tippers etc"
Playing  is waaaay too much fun
Ive been killing everyone with 's side b at like 80... That move is really the future
 has combos...and kill power...
 NICE BRO
i love the feeling of my main being ridiculous  feels so broken sometimes lmfao
"Something I got from tonight,  has some good combos"
 is aight.
I swear  are the most Looney Tunes ass character and I love it lmfao.
If only I could play a secondary.... I like  too much
Help lol  are broken.
"I looked at the  changes, pretty good tbh. Mostly a bunch of changes that make life better but I don't think they're MU changing or anything like that. We should die to random off stage a lot less now. Also Nana taking less damage/knockback than before is really nice"
“Wow! You play  on WiFi?! You must have intense online matches doing all sorts of crazy combos that require immense amounts of skill!” Me in damn near every Quickplay match:
 could unironically be top half of the cast
 is objectively better. If I played wifi for money I would never play 
"Good shit with your tournies man, keep it up  is a nut and these fools don't ever admit it."
"Hahaha, you see that man ?!  is top tier, but don't tell anyone"
those picks are just funny to me LOL  is like one of the top 3 chars in this game i actually enjoy
I think  does better vs swords than  lol
"Alright, new  MU chart. I actually think  goes even with so many characters in this game, both good and bad. If he lost as many MUs as people think i wouldn't be playing him. Go nuts! Down to discuss"
 is absolutely filthy lmfaooo.
Hey uhh  starting to feel fun...
daily reminder  is sick
YO  IS THE CRAZIEST THING IN SMASH ULTIMATE #SSBU_
 off postpatch high tier free
 still comes through for me when I need him to.
" is so fun man, I really hope he gets buffed in the next patch"
" is legit so fun He has his flaws, but always has the capacity to just obliterate people in seconds - still feel like there's a lot of room to grow too"
 is a piece of art.
 is hype.
 is really fun and silly
 wins every matp if they dont camp shield.
 is a good character in super smash bros ultimate
double  is art
I beat JW. With ! I'm happy af that I can put in work with him
When have I ever said  sucks in this game? Since day 1 I've said he is broken and top 10
 is top 10
Practicing cuz we like him
I love way too much man :(
PT still nuts just hard to be consistently at ur best with all 3 Pokémon
It's been extremely fun and challenging to improve with this character. I thinkcan be obvious in what they are looking for so getting creative has been really cool. I think the more time and experience I have with this character can lead to some really incredible stuff
 doesn’t need any changes
i love  :)
Prove that  it's a good character :)
Ultimate  is definitely my favorite . The only thing i wish he had was footstools
I’m shook lol. Literally my first time playingin 4+ months and he was MOVING
Sois top tier then.
"Pit is broken! Calling this technique the ""Lucky"""
"it's obv not free, but I wouldn't disagree if someone sayswins tbh tbh tbh"
my 's been cracked out ever since copying gavin's ledge trapping and full hop banana throw down
" is 100% viable, the reason why he isnt used too often is because too many chars do is job with additional strengths. He is best used as a CP imo. But to be a def high/top tier he literally just needs larger hitboxes on his aerials like fair. That's like it"
 is highish mid tier I think. If I seriously mained another character I would probably have more bracket success. You don't have to consider  broken good to support me. smash is a silly game I play to have fun
Man  is good!
Problem for  in the meta game is that there was no optimization. A lot of top  players didnt really optimize him while the other reps optimized him but didnt have fundies. But all of us have said from the beginning that there’s no way that  is a bad character.
I just woke up and found out I’m ranked PGRU Area 51! This is awesome considering I didn’t think I’d be mentioned at all! Took me awhile to adjust to Ult  but I think I got it down now so let’s what I can do for season 2!
" is top 5 offline and I will make a video explaining in detail why I believe this. You guys sleep on this character because you are either in denial, or you guys stay fighting Son with 0 concept of neutral."
 might be Top 1
HOLY SHIT I LOVE THE NEW  like ive already unlocked my s4 characters and already he feels way above to me
Man I love playing King . I am so glad I continued playing him from Smash 4 to Ultimate. Can't wait to see what I can do with him next year!
Hello!! Nintendo Direct we waited for starts soon! ...But are you forgetting something? Voting for Ultimate Smash Summit! My King  is very good condition and improve now! Please vote me<3
" on wifi is so dumb sometimes, I basically have pre patch upsmash LOL"
Just had the most delicious blackened tilapia and rice I made for dinner. Gonna start setting up the stream for a night of Smash. Also I love .
"Tbh I’m still getting used to  having priority on his aerials, that’s so broken lmao"
He's right. It's so frustrating to see how Smash twitter doesn't respect . He's not a Low tier at all.
"Sometimes, even if  is that stressful for me to play... this is what makes me keep playing him. I'll keep grinding!"
Please don't nerfplease oh please
Hi guys toon  is good
Toon  is my main :D i think he is so strong! Better that S4 Toon . Let me find some vids and i share u c:
Thank you Jabes Toon  strong
My Toon  is schmoovin
 match up chart from my stream yes  is very good
 is honest btw all his early kills are commital reads and bair is his only safe kill option/has no viable oos so he actually needs to respect moves. Any explosive he has is made up for by dying off of 1 correct read offstage :)
But  is sick
I think for me it was finishing EVO last year at 33rd. I made multiple upsets in losers and reminded everybody that my Villager can still be crispy. :^)
Played offline Smash today and oh my god Villager is so fucking awesome
villager could be a big threat if a good player ever picked him up
Villager is awesome don't listen to them
Megaman top10
Having faith in my megaman is really paying off! Top 8 losers side of Heart of Battle
Why does WFT have to be fun to me why can’t I like an actual character LOL
very much disagree with wft losing
"To be honest... Wii Fit  is GODLIKE. Unfortunately, WFT players aren't good enough yet (myself included) to really show off what she can do. Deep Breathing is an absurd move, their mobility and hurtbox makes them very ellusive, and Header is dumb One day, we'll prove it!"
Rosa is fun
Finished 5th at the Bootcamp tournament in Paris. I'll finally stick with Rosa for a while. She's not that bad
Y'ALL.... I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN WITH ROSA WTF SHE'S GOOD
"CLEAN Rosa stock, just a normal day"
YO MY MAC NASTY!
Someone ragequit on me Game 2 LOL I love Mac
"Surprising, yet relevant matps that Greninja does well in (imo):"
Guess Greninja is back. *Ugh* It's like a curse I can't get away from. But he's my best character by a mile and I can't deny my flow state with him when I get into it feels incredible. I'm still trying to stay local though mostly please understand I'm retired.
And Palu is just Palu. She does everything and it's only becoming more apparent over time there's no reason to not play her lol
Lowkey kinda enjoying playing new palu. Feels refreshing not being able to mash and get away with it
Seeing mad Palu talk on my timeline so I'm just here to remind you all that Palutena being a top tier is a godsend
I love the Pac-Man ditto
I got Switch Fest 2nd!!!!!! Thank you for your support!! GGs everyone!! Pac-Man too strong
why is robin so cool
"I don’t compete on WiFi but I can confidently say Robin is easily top tier online, it genuinely blows my mind how low people rate them on both offline and online at times"
Won my 2nd tournament back ^^. All Robin still. I feel like I figured something out with her and she is maybe sleeper good. Or maybe its maybelline
Read a post about Robin needing buffs. Now I'm convinced we don't need those.
shulk busted what can i say
I think Jr's top 20 tbh
I tend to survive to pretty late stages with Jr too. Pretty good recovery & heavy
"Also, I can confirm of it on reaction with hammer, back air, or up air depending on percents. I can start a low% up air chain off it as well. AND I can use it to edgeguard. Good projectiles, reasonable neutral, good combos, fine kill power. Jr is mid tier End rant"
"This is gonna sound weird but Duck Hunt is surprisingly flexible outside of being pretty much projectile based, the ways you can use them in tandem with his normals gives you plenty of freedom"
My duck hunt is nasty
"Turns out duck hunt isnt high tier, we're moving to top tier boys"
Duck Hunt works out fine I have been told ;-) Just another animal char ^^
The Ryu is back in busi
The funniest thing is is y’all caused Ryu to be buffed with all these tier lists making him bottom tier even though he was good af FOH
Ryu is sick
"Fun weekly, look at my sick halloween costume Actually having fun again with Ryu hmm"
ken is literally so cool
"Taken a liking to ken again, gonna diversify the use of the Shotos as much as I can now"
Cloud is hype as fuck. Follow me
Corrin is broken
I think I like corrin again
Cosmos beat dabuz with the worst character in the game...jk lol that was amazing i missed this corrin so bad
Talking about bayo is so fun I'm sorry
Bayo is pretty cool sometimes
Inkling is the character I have to most fun playing in Smash Ultimate I'm lucky the character I have the most fun with is also top tier LOL thank you Sakurai
Inkling is in a perfect spot right now and is in fact one of the hardest top tiers to use effectively
Nah inkling ain't stinky
"My problem is that I find Ridley significantly more fun than everyone else, so i don't have a secondary. If this is the way i want to continue, i really have to steel myself."
dw my ridley is sick
thinking about becoming strictly a ridley main on wifi and camping mega hard because it's both effective and funny
Richter is nice (sometimes)
I think Richter is really strong
K rool is high tier
Thank the lord K Rool's mid tier now
tbh Isabelle being bottom 10 is propaganda and you fools are falling for it
"won both of them, Isabelle tooooo goooooood"
I'm carried by Isabelle
"Say because there are many people who are misunderstood. A few days ago I was going to stop using isabelle. However, because isabelle played an active part in the game with Zackray, I will try to use it a little more"
Seems like I'm still an Incineroar main.
I got into Top 8 from Losers with this! Incineroar is just endlessly fun.
my incineroar is slick #ssbu
Got a hot plant waiting for ya
"I feel like shit today, let's hope plant carries me lol"
Piranha Plant is top tier
Really liking joker so far. Might post a few clips I got on elite later. Complex characters are fun :)
Hero is unironically one of the sauciest characters in the game with all of his situational confirms. He's SO SICK dude CMON
Have i mentioned that my Hero is sick? Cause my Hero is SIIIIIIIIIIIICK
Hero will never bore me
"It warms my heart to see so many players speak highly of Banjo & Kazooie. I've seen some really good players pick him up, too! His meta is developing very quickly, and he shows a lot of promise. I haven't felt anything like this with any other character that I've used so far!"
The Banjo is still crispy i must say.
"Pretty sure this mu is in banjo's favor 60-40 minimum. He can keep up in neutral, screw your landing with uair, and has several ways to stop you from recovering successfully. Also f-smash is really good against aggressive options."
Banjo is so fun! Thanks for watching guys
terry is the best character in the game
"Nah, terry got sauce."
Terry feels really good. A consistent shoto with better range on his setups and much better neutral. Just need to discover the most practical setups. Ftilt and dtilt busted
"It feels like typically the way it goes is, byleth wins neutral a few times and racks up percent because broken spacing/conditioning/juggling/ledgetrapping. Then gets hit and it evens out LOL"
Byleth is high tier!!
Went to elite smash and played byleth. Felt good
Optimal Min Min is silly
Min min is literally insane wtf
"Minmin is a good character, very fun to play and unique in some ways, got some mixups that make the character better too. I really want to see her offline and against different characters too tho. Will be uploading video tomorrow! I really wanna see how the character develops"
Also I think MinMin is hella underrated like that character makes no sense she KOs from across the stage and have slick edge guards
let me get this straight  has some of the most threatening camping in the game while simultaneously having a frame 8 usmash oos and ridiculous boxing tools
 broken btw heard it here first
i hate  but he is fun :)
Finally have my hands-on impression of Mii Brawler and he feels awesome! The spikes are even more satisfying!
Reason #1 why Mii Brawler is Top Tier
mii brawler is siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick
Won the vic ranbat with all Brawler! Busted character
Brawler is so stupid I love his upb
More and more people are starting to pick up mii swordfighter. Can't even blame em. Character is good af.
"ok i believe in mii swordfighter again, people still mad underrating this character just dont spam tornado in neutral like a bonobo lmao"
"I really don't consider Gunner as sluggish as other characters, and she *does* have some fast moves. They're not abusable, though. In my experience of the MU, upsmash helps but you're indeed correct: smart projectile usage is what wins the game."
"3331 Gunner is THE best online character. You counter every wifi zoner and are, yourself, a wifi zoner with CQC tools. There has never been a better time to learn Gunner."
"I think you should give more thought to Gunner, tbh. Why do you call her a gimmick? I feel like she's the best of the Mii Fighters, by quite a bit."
