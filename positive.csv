"I am the best Mario in the world, never forget it "
wedding mario is amazing right? 
If the Mario is very good at comboing I would say the tri plats. But overall Mario is good on every stage. It depends on who he is fighting
"mario beats everyone from dk, kirby, and loz except maybe zelda but i think its 0/+1 for mario which counts"
I can confirm Mario placement is fine Mario does beat inkling imo
YOU CAN NERF LUIGI BUT YOU CAN'T NERF ME
twitch.tv/elegantmatt69 Win streak with luigi and getting nasty clips again. Gonna try and stream for 5 hours today :) come hang and ask me questions about anything! might do viewer battles as well
Oh yeah Luigi is high tier
Luigi’s Zair can be kinda godlike
The best edge guards I've landed with DK in Smash Ultimate!
Donkey Kong's Grounded headbutt has an extra burying hitbox that gives more vertical range.
It was a good DK. I think too.！
"okay for a while kirby felt worse to me, but I'm coming around, he's probably actually better in this game than sm4sh. "
Kirby's busted ^(-^-^-)^
"I had a dream where I beat this Ike player w/ Kirby so bad that it made local news That's weird but the crazy shit was that there was like, intricacy in it. I clearly remember sitting in shield under the PS2 platform and knew the Ike would try to tomahawk grab, so I U-tilted him"
"Kirby's advantage state is also way better when the opponent doesn't have platforms to land, chasing them is easier"
Kirby dair is such a good move
live with some late night falcon shmix. been feeling a weird addiction to the new advantage routes falcon has now which is always good. I want lloyd irviing in this game
"I found a surprisingly practical 0-Death on G&W (not talking about the Knee one I shared earlier, that's basically frame perfect), all Falcon needs is a decent amount of rage and a Bair. I'm not even kidding."
"I'm genuinely starting to believe that Captain Falcon has a good chance of not only being optimal on the box, but perhaps by a lot. He currently has tons of small, but highly technical barriers that might only be feasibly, and consistently overcome on ye old clunky controller."
cant stop thinking about falcons up smash 
minecraft world is straight up pika's best stage
"Yeah a character that isn't even unanimously considered the best (or top 3) is somehow worse than characters that have 100% pick/ban rates. Smashers need to learn what ACTUAL top tiers are in other games, i swear. But Pikachu busted "
You can’t go wrong with Pikachu :) 
It is also especially good with pikachu cuz bair oos is so good 
Nice video man ! Totally agree with you on that. I feel like Pikachu is doing great too on Unova 
"ya dude pika is the best character in the game, ignore the fact that he has pretty much identical results as smash 4"
I think its pretty funny how I am a Top 2-3 Fox Top 5 Mario Top 2-3 Falco Top 3-5 Palu What can I say I'm built different
I played against min min for the first time online. I can only imagine fox destroys her but idek what that character does. I hate that she came out during quarentine lol
Fox is actually honest af now wow 
"I don’t even want to main Link, but he genuinely feels like a top tier"
I tried to do Link's Nair irl and Just broke my pants.. This move is insane 
WHAT IN GODS NAME IS THE ICE CLIMBERS PLACEMENT\n\nIF FULLY OPTIMIZED YALL ARE GOING TO LIVE HELL ON EARTH AND YOU PUT EM IN TRASH\nalso think ganon should be mid and link a bit higher
"I don't think it's actually an accident. iirc, every villain loses the mu vs their protag counterpart.\n\nMario beats Bowser\nLinks beat Ganon\nDK beats Krool\nSamus beats Ridley\nMario beats DK\nPikachu beats Mewtwo\nSo on and so forth"
Why didnt that link just use his shield to stop the IB? Aren't Link Shields busted in SSBU since they can stop all projectiles?
Maaaan Dark Samus Is so cool
Playing against @Pathoran_ on http://twitch.tv/nairomk Snake vs Samus hype
"#ad

I am PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE I am part of a @NintendoAmerica
 campaign for Super Smash Bros Ultimate . It doesn't matter what your background is, with over 70+ characters, there is a character for you.

My character? Samus. Why? Find out here:"
I can't tell if I love or hate playing Samus in this game. Leaning towards love right now
Puff is top tier
Thank you !! XD Puff in Ultimate is stronger than smash4's.
Patient Yoshi is so broken I’m really abusing his bs I just wish my punish game was up there so it would actually be optimal. I really feel like he can be a top tier character if he could be played this way but it’s easier said than done
Re: I know it’s late but here’s my first Yoshi MU chart! #ssbu_yoshi #yoshi #yoshi_ssbu
I’m realizing that Yoshi does really well against Steve we just jump around all his bullshit
Yoshi is dope 
Yoshi is the best!
Also Yoshi might lowkey be a top tier - Raptor
I don’t know why but Ness got 5 moves “buffed” -Dash attack kills 15-20% earlier which is a nice grounded kill option -Down air and flash are faster. Don’t think this will change much -Up tilt and up throw do more percent which is neat Ness is 2% better 
Ok ness is good again 
Ultimate Ness is truly wonderful 
Is it a stretch to say Ness is a top 3 dubs char
I have always felt ness-inkling is slight advantage for ness
Ness Wins
