Meh Master:RT @UnluckySummer0: Are there any Chrom, Roy, Mario, Palu, Joker or Greninja players that are interested in joining a crew,
pls theres at l‚Ä¶,,,,,
Karinovirus:@yggdrasil_ssbu @DabuzSenpai Mostly Roy and ZSS being even, and that we beat lucario and gunner. Those last 2 are really fringe so I get it i guess. Also pichu is still pretty bad,,,,
0-2 PogU:game 5 another steve player,,,,,
,,,,,
nothing special happened because there are no special steve players,,,,,
,,,,,
current quickplay roy record 4-1,,,,,
0-2 PogU:tried playing roy on quickplay,,,,,
,,,,,
pikachu player first game,,,,,
Dominic Rolf:@psy_strike Roy is definitely very hard but my old training partner was a Roy main and #3 in my state so I have an insane amount of experience in that matchup,,,,,
Woz:@VenomAZ_Ssbu Mine is with Roy,,,,,
anubis999üïä:@gyrooo1618 also ur bio should say ‚Äúbest wolf/roy in the world‚Äù,,,,,
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@Phant0mAbat Cloud Snake Roy,,,,,
,,,,,
Other characters would be Wolf and King K. Rool,,,,,
0-2 PogU:i know i didnt just see someone say roy and/or lucina are top 10 on the tl,,,,,
LeSoS (Forma de Sh!tass):@VGBC_GimR Sonic has a pretty good chance against them, except against Chrom/Roy sometimes...,,,,
‚ú®Abat:@yggdrasil_ssbu @agklubba MAN WHY YOU ALL REMOVING ROY,,,,,
CD | LMB | Kero~:@SSBU_Tekaren No veo ditto Roy Sadge,,,,,
iSimp4Gibraltar:@VedhanNPL @Arashi_SSBU Roy mains,,,,,
Buff #IVotedSmash:@IceyRat @LeverSmash Roy doesn‚Äôt really outrange us as hard as most swords do and he gets comboed pretty well because he‚Äôs tall and falls fast, while being susceptible to mario's edgeguards. Chrom has an even worse recovery than Roy does and doesn‚Äôt kill as early.,,,,
Buff #IVotedSmash:@LeverSmash Mario does well vs chroy. Its like even or slight mario but i can lean more to even for roy,,,,,
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@Phant0mAbat dude I thought Roy was the ghostbuster wtf was the Doc up-B,,,,,
J.J. (BLM):@Kindred_ssbu @SizzleSSB Have you played his roy tho???,,,,,
SOAP | Arashi Arc:No," your Roy isn't ""schmovin"" because you can jide b the gnw https://t.co/uhkYwUiA8d",,,,
Chris:@JerryTheWhale Its terrible. Notable bad placements.,,,,,
Chrom Roy Yoshi Falcon Diddy Fox Corrin Pichu Ryu ICs Isabelle Shulk,,,,,
Gambledork:@Ev_SSBU Bruh Ike better than Roy? I wish,,,,,
AdrianAnt:@ddee_ssbu Chrom/Roy no doubt,,,,,
All Day Long:@ddee_ssbu Isn‚Äôt Roy‚Äôs better than Chrom‚Äôs? Or is it the same/worse cause I‚Äôve heard a lotta people say Roy‚Äôs is,,,,,
"mia ü•±:RT @xXPkDiaz26Xx: I hate it when girls are like ""GHRGEGDHFJRH"" Like are you trying to play Ro y or something?",,,,,
VGLS | StarPingu:@buff_ssbu Applies to the matchup too but it's still even for Roy vs Mario.,,,,,
VGLS | StarPingu:@buff_ssbu Also Roy does better at killing super early and pressures better in certain situations which is why I think he's slightly better than Chrom imo.,,,,,
Buff #IVotedSmash:How come mario does well against chroy? I thought his weakness was range? ‚Äî Roy doesn‚Äôt really outrange us as hard as most swords do and he gets combod pretty well because he‚Äôs tall and falls fast while Chrom has an even worse rec‚Ä¶ https://t.co/zS1HlsaL2T,,,,,
Epic_NaN #banlylat:@ddee_ssbu defo Chrom/Roy,,,,,
chris/bore:@ddee_ssbu roy/chrom are tied for first (for different reasons), and its not even close,,,,
ValenteXD:@ddee_ssbu Roy jab combos and sets up kills at any percentage for absolutely no reason,,,,,
,,,,,
But maybe Steve diamond would be better,,,,,
GRNT | DDee:@FreshSsb *roy jab side bs you at 50%*,,,,,
Evelyn Pentakill:@ddee_ssbu Depends on how Inkling jab fits. Overall is the best jab in the game because of the ink mechanic in my opinion, but if its just considering FD and these stuff its obviously Chrom / Roy,,,,

QPG | Terry Slander Account:@Mando_SSBU How do Rosa's put that mu at -2 roy can get gimped so hard and also can have trouble getting in cause of Luma,,,,,
QPG | Terry Slander Account:@Mando_SSBU I personally think rosa has a slight advantage in the roy vs rosa mu but a still a good placement,,,,,

‚ú®Abat:@Krosshair_SSBU Yeah I think Snake and Min Min are Roy‚Äôs worst matchups on wifi.,,,,,
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@Phant0mAbat WiFi makes it a bit harder for Roy but it‚Äôs def a very close MU otherwise IMO,,,,,

PlanetSwag:@ddee_ssbu Movement based character online and less whiff punishing or reaction ledgetrapping or tech chasing. Also wtf are you reacting to against Roy besides rising nair which I still get whiff punished for on WiFi,,,,,
ValenteXD:@ddee_ssbu Roy needs speed I can't even turn off my brain properly because of the lag and I can't react on impulse,,,,,
Buff #IVotedSmash:@aFx_Punky nah idk about falcon but i agree roy beats sonic and so does snake,,,,,
üíú ~ ·¥ò·¥ú…¥·¥ã è ~ üíö:@buff_ssbu Characters that keep up with him and have better buttons like Fox, Falcon, or Roy kick his teeth in imo.,,,

DCLXVI | Merkulon:@ddee_ssbu @sword_ssb I personally put them about even. I feel like Roy's recovery is a little better but unless you hit hilt often then hes kinda jank. Chrom is a little more consistent but his really vertical/linear recovery kinda holds him ,,,,,
back. Its a toss up personally.,,,,,
GRNT | DDee:@sword_ssb How good is roy then?,,,,,
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@BentTfg U have a very weird top 5 ;-;,,,,,
Ridley Plant yoshi Joker Peach Mario and definitely greninja are to low,,,,,
chrom should be next to roy,,,,,
Snake and zss arnt top 5,,,,,
Cloud Olimar Falco Zelda Yink are 2 high,,,,,
there are a few other nitpicks but,,,,,
its a decent list,,,,,
Kadaj:This jablock setup is godlike! Super useful for when they are at %s you can't quite confirm off jab due to the platform height #SSBU_Roy https://t.co/53oKPetkGo,,,,,
