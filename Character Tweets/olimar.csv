LeFty/DeVi:@Ace_ssbu @SSBReza Olimar has the best damage output, he gets 50 off of almost ever hit he gets and is Tiny while also being dangerous at a distance and being extremely safe on shield
Goomba:@Colin_SSBU Same! I've been loving pikmin 3 deluxe but olimar in smash feels so weird. Let's hope we get pikmin 4 one day...
X NK Endor V:#UselessButInterestingInfo. Although this seems to be a very situational event and it is rare to occur in a real match, who knows? It could piss of your opponent üëÄ#SSBU_Olimar (4/4) https://t.co/RaOUYAnNzk
X NK Endor V:#UselessButInterestingInfo. The curious fact of this is that you can't either tech the forward throw with ANY pikmin in the right edge.  #SSBU_Olimar (3/4) https://t.co/7hnwvXxlkF
X NK Endor V:#UselessButInterestingInfo. You can not tech the forward throw with other than ypikmin. I have infounded assumptions about what this happens. Might be the electric property but I am not sure of this. #SSBU_Olimar (2/4) https://t.co/tSYeTXMhva      
X NK Endor V:#UselessButInterestingInfo. You can tech Olimar's forward throw with the ypikmin, at least with Ike. I tested this with Ike's low, mid and high percentages and Olimar with zero/full rage, concluding that this is teachable in a range of 4%-200% (maybe more). #SSBU_Olimar (1/4) https://t.co/nUtOoN6zsS
Omar Lloyd:@ssbu_echo @JxS_Artemis @Dylanirus Who in their right mind would make Olimar more than .75 inches tall??? Why is Ganon still a semi-clone of Falcon?
Love how, of all characters, he's the one they had to make 100% similar to his game, even though it makes no sense for Smash. Stupid question, next.
‚ô° K/S GALVAN! ‚ô°:@ddee_ssbu DO OLIMAR!
Then you can teach me what you learn. Lol
Andy Alph:@NintendoEurope @OracionGi Fix Olimar's pikmin buggs in SSBU, thanks
VGLS | SGG:I kinda wish it was possible to try out version 1.0 again just to remember what it was like. Old WFT ball physics? Pre-patch Olimar? No roll staling? Was a crazy time.
GRNT | DDee:@B_Chu_ Keep zoning
Olimar will win if Steve decides to only camp
‚òÉÔ∏èNuno‚òÉÔ∏è:Y'all need to GAS Olimar https://t.co/I5LnVJTF6q
