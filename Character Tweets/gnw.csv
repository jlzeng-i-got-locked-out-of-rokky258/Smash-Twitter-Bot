Antonio:@Arashi_SSBU top tier gatekeeper, like maybe 5th or 6th best in high tier. i usually put him next to characters like game and watch, bowser, and rob
Callumgross:@K_Jez1 @rfx313 @AndrewSamona i nearly beat him one time going all game and watch and from then on he hasn’t done it yet so my pride is savedd
Miracle:RT @TheNCSmaster: The true next gen experience.....
Game and Watch Mario! https://t.co/kwRq5jughQ
SOAP|Oofington:@Cutegirliscute I’m gonna have to disagree with you on that, it’s just because I have so much fun making people rage as game and watch
🥚DeepFriedVegan⛵:@Octave_SSBU I think for game and watch its fine to time out but you also wanna go for chip damage, like if they miss an up b (most do lol) most characters can punish that. Can you elaborate on yoshi?
Chizu (commisons open):I am getting bored of my ssbu main (mr game and watch) so what should I main next? #SmashBros

OrangeDog:I remember the year the xbox one came ou and i was the only one wanting the new Zelda 3DS. I feel the same way this week with my Game &amp; Watch haha

Luross:@aFx_Punky @SSBU_Kovu Which ones other than Ness and Game and Watch? I lowkey think Ike has a slight edge with the buffs but I might just be delusional
0-2 PogU:game 4
extremely laggy game and watch that mashed up b and smash attacks in every situation they were available
current record 3-1 (lost to the pikachu game 1 btw the way)
StrifeStar716:@ddee_ssbu Game and watch

You don't need audio when you've got game sense like @jonein_ 🧠 https://t.co/Fl2SZgRf4A
Davin Cooke:RT @TornadicSsbu: @ddee_ssbu Palu Bowser Game and Watch
TornadicVtFoE:@ddee_ssbu Palu Bowser Game and Watch
Cherry:@ddee_ssbu Game and Watch rots the brain
SOAP | Arashi Arc:To better prove how much of a music nerd I am, I have been watching 8-bit Music Theory recently. It's interesting to hear these music terms I never really learned since I was never in music theory. And all of it applied to game osts. A very interesting watch
The Fan:@ddee_ssbu Because game and watch is there
︎ ︎:@ddee_ssbu Maybe game and watch idk people have also told me pika but that's prob cause their salty they lost
Kosmic:@ddee_ssbu Game and Watch
🔸🔶 MAX 🔶🔸:Everyone wants to be carried so bad
Nothing else
No improvement
Just win because character do funny thing
And you wonder why you have a character crisis in year two of the game
tl;dr
Game &amp; Watch Down Smash buries and kills starting at 60% with good mashing and DI
Ziller moment deluxe:@SSBU_Kovu @HoshidosFinest Game and watch isn't top 5
Also it's -13
Iggy the Niggy:@GenocidalOrical @someVegan @Bobthedusclops @Ev_SSBU @NintendoVS Did you even know who Game and Watch was before Smash? 😳
BLM | Luis:@ZiggZaggin @ItsEpic_Gabriel Game watch players are bad I know I play link but Jesus Christ. No one fights Game and watch and no one likes him because he can up b out of Shield everything and he's just a masher  character
SY | CSW | MetalRathSeVen:@Mando_SSBU Looks pretty good I only want to make 4 changes Shiek in slight disadvantage or even, Mario and Game and Watch in -1 and min min somewhere is losing 4 u I don’t exactly know where but probably either slight disadvantage or 
even or -1 besides that all else looks great, great job
︎ ︎:@Mando_SSBU ness cause game and watch is better
LampShady!:@buff_ssbu Game and watch, gren, or lucina if we go from ur list
Luross:@SSBU_Kovu @aFx_Punky @KusariSSB THAT is the only thing good about Shulk in the matchup? Not other factors like outranging Game and Watch and preventing him from being able to up b out of shield?
Luross:@SSBU_Kovu @aFx_Punky @KusariSSB That sounds like a problem with your capability as a player and not Game and Watch
💜 ~ ᴘᴜɴᴋʏ ~ 💚:@SSBU_Kovu @LuigiTKO @Happy_Ducky17 Sounds like a Snake problem, not a Game and Watch strength.
💗~𝔸𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕤𝕠𝕦𝕝~💗:@SSBU_Kovu Also game and watch is like top 15 you just salty
⚡•Circuit•⚡:@SSBU_Kovu @aFx_Punky shulk's right toe fucks game and watch sideways
Ziller moment deluxe:@SSBU_Kovu @aFx_Punky Also just reminder that there are more than 5 characters better than game and watch 
You can’t seriously be telling me gnw is better than palu Shulk pika joker and whoever the fuck else
💜 ~ ᴘᴜɴᴋʏ ~ 💚:@SharOverHere_ @SSBU_Kovu If I am a Lucina player, please tell me why I should EVER approach Game and Watch.
LSG | Niko:@vysdemise also he mains game and watch
