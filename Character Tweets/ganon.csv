Buff #IVotedSmash:@White_NovaULT Rip ganon
day 15:@Krosshair_SSBU Snake with Ganon nair
Thor:@FingerStripesPM Aw was hoping to see you say you'd give Link Falco's blaster, not the other way around
In PM I legit have no idea who my second best is, so I'll pretend and say Link gets Toon Link's bair
In SSBU Cloud gets... Ganon's... nair?
Omar Lloyd:@ssbu_echo @JxS_Artemis @Dylanirus Who in their right mind would make Olimar more than .75 inches tall??? Why is Ganon still a semi-clone of Falcon?
Love how, of all characters, he's the one they had to make 100% similar to his game, even though it makes no sense for Smash. Stupid question, next.
🎃Pumpkin Fox🎃:@StarPingu @Ev_SSBU Like his only option for edgeguarding is Fair. He has the same 2 combos, and gets invalidated by disjoints because of his stubby ass legs. Mario is low tier and a contender for worst since even Ganondorf has disjoints. Mario 
doesn't.
GRNT | DDee:@Nex_SSB @RollerOverHere imo thats more of a player thing
you can make the character work because everyone except maybe mac and ganon can work
Nerva:@VedhanNPL Play my krool or Ganon
Thor:@A2ZOMG Outranges =/= outdisjoints, but it's certainly powerful
I think its utility would be a lot more obvious on someone who could actually jump... the classic Ganont/Bowser problem [SSBU finally fixed]
Nair1 advantage looks weird and I'm used to seeking edgeguards with Ganon
PMA | Defen 🇫🇷:@amiiboGoddess @Hypnotic_Switch A 10y.o kid who played the game for 10hours can bea  t a high level ganon lmao, one of the worst matchups in the game

Occam:@Niccn3im @MGK_Ganondorf 'When I'm nerfed just throw me in the trash'
Occam:@MGK_Ganondorf Move per se: falcon punch
But it ends being better because it's on a character that has very good movement
Tyrea.GG ○̴̷:@ZhaoYunSSB @ParagonX9_ This. Sakurai probably overlooked some details with custom stages when making adjustments for Steve. I’ve also seen another game crashing glitch since the Steve update.

MGK:@ddee_ssbu Ganondorf is even slower on wifi (movement / moves). Loses even harder to mashing / run away. Loses flame choke &gt; iDA 50/50.
Ganondorf only gains cheese factor which makes him way less consistent on wifi. Also forward smash is reactable on wifi.
xMa:@ddee_ssbu I think I didn't phrase my comment correctly, I wanted to say it's weird how steve wins against the two characters with the worst recoveries (ganon and mac) which is to be expected, seeing how his edgeguards are sick but then he also wins against puff because his upsmash is good
big bulb:@LudwigFrog @Mando_SSBU ganon
isn't

HK | LudwigFrog:@Mando_SSBU Btw ganon isn't low tier. https://t.co/p89pJtTOkY
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:What is the lowest tier for ur worst MU?
So
If ganon somehow beats ur character thats ur lowest tier worst MU
The Gingerbreadman:@Lonemarshyy @Imprez_ @ddee_ssbu Saying minecart wrecks ICs is like sayin “Warlock punch wins Ganon the mu, it kills us in one hit!” Only cHuMpS get hit by it. And if he goes offstage and wastes his mats and puts himself in the corner, profit.
Soda:@ddee_ssbu Mewtwo is good offline, don't know if they get buffed online or not
Ganon got buffed for sure, less time to react to a randy smash attack sure changes shit lemme tell ya
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@trislosherz luma but its ganon
