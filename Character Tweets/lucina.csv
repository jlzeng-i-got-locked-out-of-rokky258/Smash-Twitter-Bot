Main: Marth (@YuriLowenthal)

Secondary main: Roy (@RayChase), Lucina (@LauraBaileyVO), Chrom (@matthewmercer), Shulk (@A_HOWDZ), Link, Joker (@XanderMobusVO) and Ike (@gregchunva)

You forgot about lucina
GRNT | DDee:@My5Pokemon @tundessb @TristenGray1 I see ur point but your are implying that people need fundies to succeed
Min min, pac, Belmonts, etc do not require as much fundies to master even at top level than someone like lucina
Buff #IVotedSmash:@ShotgunSsbu I know, but having a sword doesnt automatically give you a winning mu vs mario. At least shulk has monados, at least cloud has limit, at least lucina has crazy edgeguards while pretty much ignoring Mario’s ladders with upb.

💚 ChaseMe 💚:@A2ZOMG @JusticeCappaGO @SSBU_Lucina one idea that I just got was that it let's you smoothly input a dash back ramram upwards-angled tilt to quickly swat away 45 degree angle jump ins while giving yourself space
A2ZOMG:@__ChaseMe__ @JusticeCappaGO @SSBU_Lucina I don't think this is common knowledge yet. The input I'm talking about is this: Dash &gt; roll the stick to the angle &gt; B

I think other Min Mins should know about it too.

My Nam Is Jam:@MatoiStrife @ddee_ssbu LUCINA IS LITERALLY FUNDAMENTALS AND NOTHING ELSE
SV:@ddee_ssbu it’s like answering this question with lucina. both are pretty simple characters that just rely on you having good fundamentals.
TiBi:@ddee_ssbu Many of those replies not realizing one thing that characters like snake pac that play their own game are those who require less amount of “fundies”... in the other hand, character like Lucina is fundi-heavy
Xio:@ddee_ssbu @Mischief_Domi Hahaha facts. Lucina has no tricks up her sleeve. Literally fundies the character 🤣
Blue⚔:@Mischief_Domi @ddee_ssbu ?? Marth and Lucina are some of the characters that rely the most on fundies
GRNT | DDee:@Mischief_Domi Lucina is literally just fundies the character
Mischievous Dom~:@ddee_ssbu Probably Marth/Lucina.

Then again, everybody needs a little bit of fundies to succeed

Miracle:Huh. Lucina is trending on Twitter? I wonder wh- oh.
Oh no.

Cool design although why must she look like a toddler? Is FEH a mix of different times? Like lore wise? I dunno.

Anyway, cool art design but the person who made it is concerning. Hmm.

U-turn(유턴):@SSBU_Lucina If Lucina space correctly, Steve can’t do anything except Dash attack &amp; Side B. Which is reactable when they get outranged.

SY | CSW | MetalRathSeVen:@RollerOverHere @Mando_SSBU 1. lucina is not 8th in the game she either low mid top or borderline top I lean toward the ladder and 2. Sonic was not below top 25 before the buffs I’m not saying sonic is better than lucina I haven’t really seen his buffs offline to gage that but he was not below top 25
Kevin:RT @megum0_kun: One more from my collection of Smash Girls maid version, Lucina is delighted to call you master

PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:yes i agree he is heavily slept on
i think hes low high tier but
you saying people not being able to optimize marth kinda just counter claims ur statment
marth can honestly be better than lucina if played correctly however
people dont know how to play marth correctly
my thoughts https://t.co/DSTIgYT2gv
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:RT @Phant0mAbat: @RollerOverHere @Mando_SSBU Sonic being better than Lucina literally isn't even a hot take lol
✨Abat:@RollerOverHere @Mando_SSBU Sonic being better than Lucina literally isn't even a hot take lol
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@OreoBayonetta lucina is high tier
marth is upper mid
he has the potential its just
not there yet
just fix his tippers first
OreoBayonetta:@Mando_SSBU Because he's better
Or at least extremely close to Luci
Stop putting Lucina in top tier and Marth in mid tier when they're echos challenge
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@OreoBayonetta smh
oreo
stop thinking marth is better lucina challenge &lt;3
failed
but marth has to space more
and rosa is good at that
Dragon:RT @_HavocSnake_: this Lucina going thru it rn https://t.co/Igf1l1fwMw
OreoBayonetta:@Mando_SSBU Why
In the living fuck
Is Lucina slight disadvantage
AND MARTH IS EVEN?!
MARTH SHOULD BE -1 CUZ HE'S LUCINA EXCEPT YOU DIE AT 60
Kate “hot woman gf” .x:@ddee_ssbu @ixblip I think Lucina is questionable but Steve’s up-tilt is good for low percent combos, is a good anti-air but lacks because he isn’t very fast, and a character like falco definitely has a better up-tilt because of its larger hotbox and higher combo potential
GRNT | DDee:@Foxx_SSB @ixblip But actually I’m confused
How do you think Steve’s up tilt isn’t better than Lucina shotos etc
Legitimate question
GRNT | DDee:@ixblip @Foxx_SSB Have you ever touched Steve before btw
Cause saying lucina’s isn’t better
blip!!:@ddee_ssbu @Foxx_SSB lucina, snake, wolf, fox maybe, shotos etc

LampShady!:@buff_ssbu Wario not lucina lmao
LampShady!:@buff_ssbu Game and watch, gren, or lucina if we go from ur list
Buff #IVotedSmash:@PFire22 I honestly don’t know what lucina’s neutral is like but I cant imagine it being worse than wario’s for sure
Pure_Fire22:@buff_ssbu Easily Wario. Lucina might be a distant second worst, but I'm not 100% sure on that.
Shly 🌠:@SSBU_Lucina That's okay
Sola 🌻 RWBY VOL8!:@ddee_ssbu With Lucina a lot of her play works off reactions, not having reaction ledge trapping hurts her really bad and same even for reacting off stage even for some mu's, and she has to get reads for ko's more often because of it.

PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@coolness0228 @RealSuperSlime watching the lucina one is literally JUST reads and edgeguarding
i think I win here
E. | Tae:@Mando_SSBU @RealSuperSlime See, i def see this lol. But lucina IS a fundies character. There are only a select few lucina’s mains not to mention clips of her actually saucin people up. Tho if you wanna say that then I would have to say the 0-death or 
the abundance of 0-deaths rob has is lame.
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@Tae_Ssb @RealSuperSlime side b is SO annoying I will not lie but
