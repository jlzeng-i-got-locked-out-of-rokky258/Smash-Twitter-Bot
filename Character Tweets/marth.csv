Λ | Soul Shadow:@SSBU_Creators @TrigonSmash I can see perfectly fine the samus down throw -&gt; charge shot, marth down throw -&gt; bair, shulk nair -&gt; monado smash -&gt; backslash and cloud dash attack -&gt; fair

LC | Anton:@Eclipse_SSBU I know it does, but I want it to kill earlier again lol. A decent portion of my kills with Lucina and Marth are with fair.
Keyunna Burt (Student at U.A. High School):Here’s my main and secondary main characters in Super Smash Bros Ultimate:
Main: Marth (@YuriLowenthal)
Secondary main: Roy (@RayChase), Lucina (@LauraBaileyVO), Chrom (@matthewmercer), Shulk (@A_HOWDZ), Link, Joker (@XanderMobusVO) and Ike (@gregchunva)

Vegeta main:@WoahAnton Aye main I respect the grind, don’t take it as an insult, everyone can play their own way and make it work, but my marth is ridiculously patient so i’m not used to seeing an aggressive marth
Vegeta main:@WoahAnton The lack of patient play in this marth gameplay is making me have a gamer moment
Buff #IVotedSmash:@ajb312 @TuPapiMaiz @itsthatdudeok He loses to cloud and marth too imo. 4 swordies which isnt even a quarter of swordies. There’s some sus mus for Mario like gnw, palu and maaaybe zss, but rest is even or mario favored.
qwirky HEGA:@ddee_ssbu Marth with a diamond sword
SSG | Psydux:@battlefieldvei1 @LuigiTKO Marth is better Lucina bro
Skyline16:@eggs_ssbu I guess you see it different. I think at this point any small buff like that pushes marth up alot imo. You can't buff marth too much cause then he becomes op. Marth has to be buffed carefully or else he becomes really broken.
Eggs:@ssbSkyLine16 ah.  idk about top 10 tho, there are so many characters i think are better than marth
Skyline16:@eggs_ssbu Pretty much allows marth to get tech chasing opportunities off of a throw. This would be huge for him in so many situations. It's seems little but it opens up a safer option for an f smash or db read at kill %
BluesClues:@hobart_tm @Cutter_FGC When they say “it’s impossible to get tippers” “he’s so inconsistent” and “Marth is just garbage” and then you tell them to play Marth and they can’t space and never land tippers (except that one accidental tipper) because they are just too close when attacking.
Thep:@DefinitelyPablo wtf is Marth doing in a tier
NL | Eclipse #BLM:Max rage Marth is something to fear
Blue⚔:@Mischief_Domi @ddee_ssbu ?? Marth and Lucina are some of the characters that rely the most on fundies
Mischievous Dom~:@ddee_ssbu Probably Marth/Lucina.
Then again, everybody needs a little bit of fundies to succeed
ProNerdy:@Dark_Wizzy_ probably the same people that made Marth's grab https://t.co/lyghzUtlwb
Buff #IVotedSmash:Im thinking less and less of marth the more i think about it
Buff #IVotedSmash:@Phant0mAbat Wait diddys in the same tier as marth...
Co Leader of The Hive Mine:Would really like to get on #SmashBrosUltimate  rn but I had bad timing �  I went into my room to late while she was sleeping and woke up as soon as I got into my room to use my boy #ssbu_marth
Buff #IVotedSmash:Does mickle have good takes — Mans has marth top tier, fuck no LOL https://t.co/Vt745KHAkG
SCM☆Rudulf🇳🇮🇨🇦:@YaBoiShy_SSBU I Just want Marth and Lucina on it!
I Draw Dream 💚 | Tweeted Epic Art again:some anime series/games that I recommend
&gt;the persona series (personal fav: persona 3)
&gt;fire emblem series (fav chara: marth and alm, from different series btw)
&gt;ssbu (game lit)
&gt;sao (worship eugeo oi)
&gt;danganronpa (cute but dark)
&gt;magi (youll love this trust me)
&gt;jojo (cuz yes)
U-turn(유턴):@SSBU_Lucina So Steve MU as Lucina feels like   Luigi or Ice climber MU I think..
U-turn(유턴):@SSBU_Lucina If Lucina space correctly, Steve can’t do anything except Dash attack &amp; Side B. Which is reactable when they get outranged.
Chito:@YaBoiShy_SSBU @Mr_Butter112 Mario and Marth but marth should have the blue alt not the original
mia 🥱:@trislosherz marth is hawt doe
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:yes i agree he is heavily slept on
i think hes low high tier but
you saying people not being able to optimize marth kinda just counter claims ur statment
marth can honestly be better than lucina if played correctly however
people dont know how to play marth correctly
my thoughts https://t.co/DSTIgYT2gv
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@OreoBayonetta the game was hella close ngl
it was me at like 140% and him at 30$ marth uair fair airdodge read fair again tipper fair back to stage
read (forgot what it was) fair and won
OreoBayonetta:@Mando_SSBU HAVE YOU PLAYED MARTH?!
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@OreoBayonetta lucina is high tier
marth is upper mid
he has the potential its just
not there yet
just fix his tippers first
OreoBayonetta:@Mando_SSBU Because he's better
Or at least extremely close to Luci
Stop putting Lucina in top tier and Marth in mid tier when they're echos challenge
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@OreoBayonetta smh
oreo
stop thinking marth is better lucina challenge &lt;3
failed
but marth has to space more
and rosa is good at that

MC | Raffobaffo:@ddee_ssbu Brawl Snake out Rangers fucking marth's sword
OreoBayonetta:@Mando_SSBU Why
In the living fuck
Is Lucina slight disadvantage
AND MARTH IS EVEN?!
MARTH SHOULD BE -1 CUZ HE'S LUCINA EXCEPT YOU DIE AT 60
ca:@Graffiti_ssbu play marth
GRNT | DDee:@homelesskoops Explain ryu and marth
Sm4sh Mario is braindead but not as good as Steve since Steve’s has more uses
The others are better

never heard of that
χ:@Warex77 @TheFan__4 @ddee_ssbu I'd call Melee-Marth-Up-Tilt better than Ult-Steve-Up-Tilt
Meh Master:@Mando_SSBU I think Marth (idk what he is anymore maybe like low high tier at *best*)

EdiblePine Plays:@Mando_SSBU Ima tell you rn, jr isn’t that low. When you get in, he’s actually broken. Also marth, ike, cloud, and the pits are also to low
Areos:@anubis999_ssbu Hmmm. I get a LOT of shield breaks cause of conditioning, but I’d probably go with up tilt platform conversions. Can get me a free 50% or so, all true or nearly true. (Marth)
