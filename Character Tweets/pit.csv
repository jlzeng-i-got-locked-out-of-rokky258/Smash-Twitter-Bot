Josh #Taxx2020:@powdr_ssbu I just literally haven't seen anyone but Dabuz use him and apparently he's playing pit super wrong according to my friend so idk
I never had much confidence in the character and didn't really think he got buffed too much that helped something that wasn't already there
Josh #Taxx2020:@powdr_ssbu I seriously still think pit is garbage, but I know a lot of pit players strongly disagree
