OD | Neos (ONLY A THANKFUL):@Kosh1_ssbu I wanna tell them how to sdi sheik combos then roast them for not knowing how to sdi sheik combos
dragonned:RT @Narouherallaman: After Sheik last week, I wanted to animate one of the players who made me discover competitive Smash a few years ago.…
LeFty/DeVi:@Ace_ssbu @SSBReza Sheik has the best neutral, kills consistently at about 90%, deals ~50 in one combo, edge guards like a beast, amazing oos, very safe on shield
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@DadSsbu Look Sheik’s DACUS in Brawl was ridiculous I think she’d be much better with just that alone lmao
All the other stuff certainly helps too
INK | Dad?:@Krosshair_SSBU sheiks strengths just increase. top 10. fair dacus? i mean sheik already has kill confirms out of neutral tools but a -2 aerial? please. pp and jab cancels just extend combos and make suffocating neutral even stronger
Buff #IVotedSmash:RT @DairInNeutral: “Sheik is mid tier. The character has zero damage output and can’t kill” https://t.co/skfAWFVB0U
🔸🔶 MAX 🔶🔸:RT @aFx_Punky: Sheik has the best neutral.
Buff #IVotedSmash:@aFx_Punky I dont agree but i can see sheik’s being the best. Mega and sheik are in the top 2
SOAP | Arashi Arc:@ThunderNB Ummm yeah he was that Sheik main, right? I heard something about him earlier this week so I unfollowed him
W4zpy#7997 🇲🇽:@ddee_ssbu sheik is the way to go chief
spection @ asdfghjkl:@ddee_ssbu sheik then
Diegohd:@ddee_ssbu I actually have played iron man at least one every day the maximum I got was from Mario to sheik
SYC | TEW | Tsubasa #MarioGalaxy:@orca_sheik @_nano_02 tell them
SOAP|Oofington:@Tyler_SCR Bruh no one knows how to counter pick sheik cause only two people play sheik @gsmVoiD and @SaintPepsi__
Buff #IVotedSmash:@isoSSB Sheik above mario 😒
AX2:@YaBoiShy_SSBU Sheik front while charging needles behind a white background. Then maybe fox and Lucina stock icons.
🔸🔶 MAX 🔶🔸:Wi-Fi Sheik clips that aren't even that cool or flashy that I want off my SD card
I can't be assed to record without in-game music so I will drown it out with stock music https://t.co/8ycR1kHoWd
Ʌ̶e̶t̶h̶ | デイジー🌼:@willdudebro @SushiSSBU Yeah when I was like 7. I felt cool because I played with with friends and I was the only person who knew that Zelda.... Was sheik  🤯🤯

Echo:@Krosshair_SSBU @PsIjewdas @IncomeTaxxx Yea the game was slow but we still had prominent characters like Bayo that killed people below 60% consistently, Rage Ryu, Cloud, Mario ladders, DK and Bowser kill confirms, ZSS ladders, fast characters like Mewtwo, 
Falcon, and Sheik... Idk. 2 stocks in Sm4sh made NO sense to me
anubis999🕊:@PharaohSSB don’t play sheik vs icies they win
play yoshi
NL | Eclipse #BLM:RT @gsmVoiD: Who doesn't love more Sheik???

Kuno 🐸🐸:@Mando_SSBU icies sheik
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@Sevenssb no sheik is actually free its so hard for her to hit luma sometimes
mario no I play him and its not winning for mario not even even
gnw... bro
thats one of gnw's losing MUs LOL
Min min i said is slight disadvantage
maeger🦧@dark(netflix og):Who would you main if your main is removed from the game?
I’d probably switch to Sheik. Only reason I don’t play her now is because Shulk is already a difficult technical character and Sheik requires a lot of lab time
Sheik is my love!:RT @Eros_013: The funniest thing is watching him flying to the blast zone.

MatthewM:@ddee_ssbu Why is Sheik only a plus 0.5? It feels like he gets absolutely dominated in neutral

Maximus:@ddee_ssbu Joker, for the same reason as Sheik.  His combo game is pretty technical at a high level, and the lag affects inputs. Sure, Arsene is still hella good regardless, but even he's hindered by it since it can mess up kill confirms.
PMI | Beanman:@ddee_ssbu I play sheik

Aurora:@buff_ssbu Like the only character you could even convince me is somewhat comparable is Sheik.
Ryan:@ddee_ssbu Sheik.
That is all
+Brady+Is+A+Homs+:Examples: Jump force (Kurapika),SSBU (sheik), Street Fighter (Ingrid)
Cashanator:@ddee_ssbu Sheik WiFi ledgetrapping 🤢
Vaquero:@ddee_ssbu Sheik and peach are easier but there are 10 MUs that become much harder
Ethan Shuffler:@ddee_ssbu It’s sheik
Dylan:RT @STRIKDERP: My main gurl, Sheik! #SSBU #SmashBrosUltimate #cutiesaturday #Sheik https://t.co/1pXrRIV04h
💜 ~ ᴘᴜɴᴋʏ ~ 💚:@SSBU_Kovu He's light, stubby, limited mobility wise, struggles to kill sometimes, can't deal with range, very bare bones basic and isn't gonna progress like other characters such as Sheik or Joker, and probably a few more.
He's good but top five is a sin.
Anti Hero | BLM:@ddee_ssbu Fox and sheik
Dripzilla:Some early stonks 😤
#ssbu_sheik https://t.co/pBRTyi1JFO
Golder Gold:@Mando_SSBU At least you didn't put Rosa and sheik in top 5
Also puff is not THAT bad

Buff #IVotedSmash:What am I supposed to do vs sheik
TAFS|Help?:@buff_ssbu @CrackersFGC maybe but if so slightly and gren has a case for beating sheik too
imo they are both equally bad matchups, if not mario is like negligably worse
Buff #IVotedSmash:@fatpikastan @CrackersFGC Yeah and mario beats sheik
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@Sire_Snook Okay i think imma make a tierlist with everyones takes
Sonic is really good now the Uair hits
Mario and Lucina honestly yeah looking back
Sheik... bro u living under a rock

LeSoS (Forma de Sh!tass):@EssentiaSheik Sheik doesn’t win against Sonic 🤨
実梨🍒:@Nozomichan26 Thank youuuuu!😭😭😭🙏✨
Zelda and Sheik's final smash has changed the direction of each from SSBU, and I love how cool they both are!😍😍💖
The glow-in-the-dark effect and the golden eyes are so cool that I wanted to draw that once. I was happy to be able to draw it(∩´∀｀)∩🖊
