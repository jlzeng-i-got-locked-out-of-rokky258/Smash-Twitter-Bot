Xfire:TIL Incineroar has the lowest intangibility frames (1-18) for ledge roll. I thought it was universal like jump or neutral getup...

Even DDD and freaking DK have the longest intangibility frames besides G&amp;W, Luigi, and Pichu...

Key The Dedede:@ddee_ssbu Just play DDD already it makes too much sense
Ziller moment deluxe:@KeyDedede @ddee_ssbu WAIT WTF HE DOESN'T PLAY DEDEDE?
It's luigitko all over again....
Sheena Johe:@flow_ssbu Because apparently the gordo change was intended, which makes sense since apparently it calculated the shieldstun (?) wrong before
Too bad for dedede yeah x D

SpideyWebb:@ddee_ssbu Did dedede get deleted lol
KingPepepe:@ddee_ssbu Where’s king DDD
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:RT @aFx_Punky: Idc what yall say, DeDeDe's up b is one of the most SEX moves in the game.
FruitLoops:@buff_ssbu they should pick up d3 for like their 3 bad mus besides palu.
FruitLoops:@buff_ssbu then i use D3 instead for that specific mu, its more than doable for him
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@HyperDedede D3?
Hot
Play?
Yes sirrr
💜 ~ ᴘᴜɴᴋʏ ~ 💚:@SSBU_Kovu @DairInNeutral @KusariSSB And I am very good at the Palu mu with almost every character I play but I'd be a fucking idiot to suggest that Palu DeDeDe is close to an okay match up. Your personal exp in an mu =/= how the mu ACTUALLY works.
