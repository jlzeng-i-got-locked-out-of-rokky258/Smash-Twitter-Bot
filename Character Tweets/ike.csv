BLM | Luis:I'm done playing Smash Bros by now. had to fight a boring Ike player just fishing for Nair. They all play the same. I don't care what I say if I play Rob or link. But end up beating him twice
Joshi #Taxx2020:@MandosGalaxy Do you think Rosa wins the Ike matchup?

X NK Endor V:#UselessButInterestingInfo. You can tech Olimar's forward throw with the ypikmin, at least with Ike. I tested this with Ike's low, mid and high percentages and Olimar with zero/full rage, concluding that this is teachable in a range of 4%-200% (maybe more). #SSBU_Olimar (1/4) https://t.co/nUtOoN6zsS

Joshi #Taxx2020:@JevorokUlt Maybe it‚Äôs just Ike mains live on ps2 lmfao
Yunny:@Joshi_SSBU I actually think that Ike wins instead, Ike cheeses Ike recovery. Although the same can be said about Ike, hmmm.

But jus take into consideration
Ike quite literally has kill confirms at 60-80%

Remember
You lost to my 2 month/1month Ike https://t.co/fv4SFtEsQF
HL | Irony:@Joshi_SSBU Maybe its just me, but I don't think I've been hit by an ike combo that dealt over like 40, as Falco, 40 is a pathetic string, maybe my memory is failing me tho, we can run some games tonight if you care to prove me wrong
Joshi #Taxx2020:@IronyCloud I agree with this but
Falco
Does
More damage
Than Ike https://t.co/ZJ2qGJaLwm
HL | Irony:@Joshi_SSBU Here's what I say about ike, we do significantly more damage than ike does, ike up b, if done to high can be hit by shine, Falco is slightly faster and whiff punishes pretty well vs ike, from my experience, I put it as slightly Falco favor, but its not a giant win by any means
Chito and 250 others liked your tweet:@InsomniaPOG @SOLO_ssb The Ike, yeah
