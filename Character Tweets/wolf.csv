Rhixcs:Finally got a Wolf flash kill (just need to practice comboing into it) #ssbu #ssbu_wolf #SuperSmashBrosUltimate #SuperSmashBros https://t.co/MbSgkKJMxt
Arch Nemesis #6762:@rileythelad_ @raimeee_ Dope Wolf man, you think it'd be possible if I got some MU exp sometime? 
I play an uncommon character being Ryu myself, so it could work out both ways 🙂
Adam:@ddee_ssbu Zss? Oh just Wolf and Shulk and Pika. Shiek too. That shit sucks.
Carter:@Maister_SSB @ddee_ssbu It's like "sir, I'm playing wolf, you want me to not nair?"
Rhixcs:I should probably have lost this match, but I'm learning to play patient even when I'm stocks behind #ssbu_wolf #ssbu_krool #ssbm #SuperSmashBrosUltimate https://t.co/3yyEO1AtU8

anubis999🕊:@ApolloKage yea wolf is crazy 😃👍🏻
Syndrome:@LANKingGaming It was an online tournament and I went 0-2 against two wolf mains... it was horrible.
TTO-Nimbus:@shadow_4_smash @VGBC_GimR Wolf goes even with swordies for the most part but loses ro joker
anubis999🕊:@gyrooo1618 also ur bio should say “best wolf/roy in the world”
Pure_Fire22:@buff_ssbu @aFx_Punky Wolf's neutral is extremely good as well, he might be a contender for Top 2.
LegendaryCaptain:@PJiggles_ Hard to say my #1 favorite but it is my favorite melee remix my favorite smash bros remixes in no order are
-fire field (brawl)
-hidden mountain and forest (brawl)
-crocodile cacophony (ssbu)
-star wolf (brawl)
-together we ride (melee)
-mad monster mansion (ssbu)
-this
もな:RT @ToastWtfFTW: Young Link MU Chart
I think he's pretty broken now, borderline top 20 or there
- We might beat Gren, Peach, Terry, and T…
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@Phant0mAbat Cloud Snake Roy
Other characters would be Wolf and King K. Rool

🌩 Storm 🌩🏳️‍🌈:@Boodabam2002 @VedhanNPL I might be wolf main
Chito and 250 others liked your tweet:@PandaGlobal Wolf
AzLuFa | NRN:Takes I had when I first started playing SSBU that sound like @/LudwigFrog takes :
"Wolf has the best back throw in the game"
"Chrom has the best recovery in the game"
"Sonic is too fast he's not a very good character"
elitetweet:@Apex_SSBU i also play fox lucina wolf inkling cfalcon
HK | LudwigFrog:@anubis999_ssbu Wolf has better air speed. Oh yeah wario has better mobility too.
anubis999🕊:@LudwigFrog WOLF DOES NOT HAVE BETTER MOBILITY WHAT
i’m not gonna argue w u bc u have notoriously bad opinions but u r wrong LOL
HK | LudwigFrog:@anubis999_ssbu No his parry game is shit. Try matching the belmonts parry game or warios. Well his is not bad but not the best. He loses 3 mus, and his mobility is not top 3, ZSS chroy and wolf have better mobility. And his ledge trapping is not top 10. Hes top 10 but not 5.
PARADOX | Bruh:@ddee_ssbu Wolf, Bowser, maybe Ridley if he was good lmao
♡ K/S GALVAN! ♡:@ddee_ssbu Joker requires the least amount of fundies to succeed at mid level.
But at high/top level it's prolly Wolf, Luci, or Mario, most top player's have a pocket of those Characters and I don't see them putting in the time for those Characters but still able to succeed fairly easily.
NadzAA:Vive wolf 😂😂

Chaos 🖤:@Bombz_ @ddee_ssbu Huh? Wolf?
GRNT | DDee:@Bombz_ Wolf???
neekolul but better:@ddee_ssbu @Mischief_Domi No that's wolf
Ness Wednesday:@UnluckySummer0 @Krosshair_SSBU I'm gonna have to second this. Even if Wolf isn't as common as most top tiers today, he's still extremely good
Unlucky:@Krosshair_SSBU Wolf way too low
RAID | MintyFresh:@SGG_SSBU Wolf dsmash killing at like 60😭
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@nescartridges They should’ve replaced the shitty red alt with this one
I miss Wolf having the drip
PRG | iTMe:@ddee_ssbu Surprisingly never really loved playing Wolf, but I can see it
GRNT | DDee:@iTMe_SSB Maybe wolf
GRNT | DDee:@9superpie Young link or wolf
🎃🍂Pin🍂🍗:I still think wolf's head design in ssbu looks miles ahead better than whatever the fuck fetus looking head he had before https://t.co/F4GRseRvup
✨Abat:@buff_ssbu PS2 is way bigger and the plat layout is more generous.
Wolf basically gets locked into shield on SBF and isn't able to move around so everyone can just mash on him, especially sword characters.
GRNT | DDee:@lbptrixen Wolf
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@DarkenedYosho ridley i think but then u changed to the wolf and then

ʟᴜᴄᴀɴɪᴄ #blm:@ddee_ssbu I play cloud, mario, belmonts, wolf, and pit, I can't convince shit
Zespeon Adventure DX:@MickleChrom @buff_ssbu Actually reasonable. Why wolf? Diddy I could maybe see, Idk about you but Sonic beats her +1 shes too floaty, slow, cant edgeguard as much, and get screwed by regular sonic stuff.
🏳️‍⚧️ 1 and Only Festive Pizza 🏳️‍⚧ #IvotedSmash:@ddee_ssbu Wolf is just Wolf, probably a tiny bit   better
anubis999🕊:@ashleyinreal and you can’t jump or approach like unsafely. backwards drifting short hop to bait bairs and other approaches are really good, and laser is also rlly good. imo squirtle is the only reason wolf pt is close to even, so ur goal is just to 
get them to ivy. being on a plat is also good
vy ☾︎.*·̩͙꙳:@ddee_ssbu is there something that makes wolf good on wifi?
LSG | Niko:@GenFNY my rob and wolf and steve 📈📈📈
ΞLG | Dackt:@fishyDiddyKong @OriPlant @ssb_Silver @storm_ssbu @Sytierix I did, I beat him with Wolf smh.
