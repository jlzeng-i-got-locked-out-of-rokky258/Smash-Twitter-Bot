Godot:@atro_ssbu Ok Peach Main, top 5 character lookin ass
Atrocious:@EatLivers just seeing this but peach is still trash so I don't see your point NERD
Buff #IVotedSmash:@drayden___ He can hire good security so Peach doesn’t get kidnapped for once
AD | Krozone:@aFx_Punky So peach mains.
Mugsy:@ddee_ssbu YALL PEACH IS SO EASY TO LEARN WTF
Jigglypuff is the greatest character ever!!!!!!!!!:@ddee_ssbu Who in their right mind votes for Peach
You need to understand the complexities of Melee Puff far better than you would have to with a brain dead wifi masher zoner
PT | RedLuigi:@Aen_SSBU You ain't no Mario if you have opinions like this bruh
Marios never turn back on Peach smh
Swidd:@SnipeMastery @ddee_ssbu 2 Peach players in the PGRU 50 and 3 Jigglypuffs in the MPGR, honestly they are pretty even.
mia 🥱:@trislosherz daisy....?
GBG | Lanman:@ddee_ssbu Glad I'm woke enough to pick Ultimate Peach.
pici/neoprene:@ddee_ssbu People don’t know about optimized ultimate peach movement literally being ridiculous to execute. Jcff, djcff, shjcff,  etc
mia 🥱:@riddledittle is daisy annoying

Peach is still better!!!

And I like her personality more, Daisy is still amazing Tho (:
Valloween 🦇:@theblumamba @ddee_ssbu I am a Peach player
Blutao 青✌🏻💙:@ddee_ssbu How is peach winning I hate it here
Blutao 青✌🏻💙:@ValToadstool @ddee_ssbu This isn’t true at all, learning her tech is actually the easy part. It’s her neutral and how to apply the tech that’s really difficult. I learned her tech very well but I couldn’t do anything with it since I couldn’t actually get a hit. All the peach players would agree btw
0-2 PogU:@trislosherz i dont think i have ever seen a peach player uptilt
Jose Enriquez:@ddee_ssbu Puff is easier in technicalities but requires better fundies in melee peach in ultimate is a little harder but can very ignorant in some matchups
Stunna slave:@ddee_ssbu Peach isn't even hard.
AzLuFa | NRN:@ddee_ssbu @smollfryes There we go, peach is our winner then
Thanks DDee
͏SmallFry 🍣 NRN:@ddee_ssbu @Az_Lu_Fa Peach takes the cake free
mrwaffy:@ddee_ssbu I said puff because inorder to master a character you also have to master the game, which makes peach easier to master imo
𝕞𝕒𝕣𝕚𝕤𝕤𝕒:RT @hi_im_daisyy: Daisy illustration from the SSBU Poster on the Switch! 🌼 https://t       .co/DSJsLpNHSk
fludd:@ddee_ssbu @TasmanianSam @TDT_SCents imo, peach overall is more technically difficult. decision making is where i think puff becomes more complex. with puff being so light, paired with rest being so punishable on whiff, character feels harder to master.  
EnterMystic #RoadtoBestSteve:@ddee_ssbu melee puff is the easiest character in melee to learn. Definitely ult peach
please spare me from this hellish existence:@ddee_ssbu Melee is a harder game in general, but compared to the rest of the cast WITHIN their own game, peach is a lot harder.
Snipe Mastery:@EchidonaAz @ddee_ssbu You played peach right?
Valloween 🦇:@rot______ @ddee_ssbu I've mained Peach for 2+ years and I can confidently say she's not that hard
Violet~ (Porygon):@BurnerAcc_0 @ddee_ssbu I thought it was like if the average melee player picked puff and the average ult player picked peach the puff player would have a way easier time than the peach
GRNT | DDee:@kusari_yt Melee puff is the easiest melee character
Peach is like the hardest ultimate character
Sam:@TDT_SCents @ddee_ssbu Yes, but you NEED all of that tech to truly MASTER her. All you need for ultimate Peach is to master float cancelling and good fundamentals/spacing
INK | Echidona:@Nex_SSB @ddee_ssbu and i play ult peach 😐
aza.:@ValToadstool @ddee_ssbu Peach neutral is def hard to master, slow with little range, you need to have a deep understanding of her mechanics. That’s why every random mid tier main is like yeah I bet peach 😎 she can’t get in haha
tw// bwark🎃:@ddee_ssbu Peach is breaking your hand
Hobbesbing:@ddee_ssbu Interesting comparison. The easiest high tier in melee vs probably the hardest in ult. I guess just the level of tech and optimization in melee means every character is difficult by most standards. I do understand how people voted peach though float cancel shit is tricky
Valloween 🦇:@ddee_ssbu All you need to learn Peach is simple muscle memory
