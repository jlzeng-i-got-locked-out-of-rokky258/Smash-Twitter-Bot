Puni$hed Maíz:@buff_ssbu Wario?
Buff #IVotedSmash:@Woopermann ah
imo rob is definitely inkling's worst mus and some of her losing mus are pika, shulk, paisy, mario, pac, yoshi, samus, fox and maybe wario
anubis999🕊:@Mr_NairSSB lowest i can see him is behind wario https://t.co/MoUNCAnbov
LC | Anton:@aFx_Punky @ddee_ssbu @MatoiStrife He would still be very good, probably high tier still. But since you wanna talk about removing a move, what would you replace it with?
Wario overall is a very good character.
💜 ~ ᴘᴜɴᴋʏ ~ 💚:@WoahAnton @ddee_ssbu @MatoiStrife Would Wario still be considered by most top tier without waft?
LC | Anton:@aFx_Punky @ddee_ssbu @MatoiStrife Wario is pretty far removed from a gimmick character.
You know when he's gonna get waft AND he doesn't need it to win because he has multiple other routes to rack up damage, trap you, and take stocks.
On top of that, his overall mobility is insanely good, and his normals are too.
★SOAP | ThanksEVing 🦃🍂★:@StatusQuo_ta Wario is one ugly nigga D3 is debatable
Jailien/Jalengu:@ddee_ssbu @GodspeedMario Wario?
GRNT | DDee:@aFx_Punky @MatoiStrife Wario isn’t a gimmick
He has a great solid moveset and even without waft he still has many good tools
Good disadvantage with bike, good speed, etc
Steve doesn’t have much outside of punish game imo
💜 ~ ᴘᴜɴᴋʏ ~ 💚:@ddee_ssbu @MatoiStrife I disagree with saying he's top twenty but can you really count him out because he's a "gimmick" character when we have Wario?
anubis999🕊:@Geist_SSB kk. haven’t played ur wario yet lol so we should get some in sometime
Josh #Taxx2020:@anubis999_ssbu Wario, Fox, arguably falco because he just uptilts out of parry and does 70, GnW depending on the move he parried, and that's just off the top of my head
Yeah I didn't have a point but your phrasing was wild with that bruh
HK | LudwigFrog:@anubis999_ssbu Ok and wario can just nair you to death if he has waft at 0% off a parry. And don't tell me down tilt is gonna hit a max spaced shulk bair parried.
HK | LudwigFrog:@anubis999_ssbu Wolf has better air speed. Oh yeah wario has better mobility too.

LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@realHARTHUR @Phant0mAbat All Abadango asked for was “a buffed Wario” and the four of them went overboard LMAO
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@realHARTHUR @Phant0mAbat So… out of aMSa, Ranai, Earth, and 9B, who do we blame for Wario being the way he is in this game?
Chris:Kameme has a wario why didnt he do it https://t.co/QqW27gMMsc

Ʌ̶e̶t̶h̶ | デイジー🌼:@Prince_Dave13 But likewise. Didn't think wario would be a fun mu and I never knew wario existed before ya tbh. Now I'm scared of waft everytime I get up tilt by one😂. Forever grateful for the PTSD  you gave lol

eve (she/her):@anubis999_ssbu @MickleChrom Whiff punishing can apply to any character, wario excels but I don't think it's enough to give him a top tier neutral
anubis999🕊:@SsbuHalcyon @MickleChrom 2 wafts
point is wario doesn’t have to approach so his lack of rage is not a problem at all
anubis999🕊:@SsbuHalcyon @MickleChrom he is the best character at camping in the game
he WANTS to be camped and contesting w swords is not a problem with whiff punishing. wario is not a rush down character LMAO
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@RollerOverHere Pika joker palu/wario/peach however u order it, shulk zss PT wolf snake
then
mario sonic lucina
DM 22:@buff_ssbu It might be Wario
LampShady!:@buff_ssbu Wario not lucina lmao
Buff #IVotedSmash:@PFire22 I honestly don’t know what lucina’s neutral is like but I cant imagine it being worse than wario’s for sure
Pure_Fire22:@buff_ssbu Easily Wario. Lucina might be a distant second worst, but I'm not 100% sure on that.
Buff #IVotedSmash:@Mando_SSBU You really think they have a worse neutral than wario?
Coolness0228:@buff_ssbu probably wario. other contender is probably fox
SeanVGM🎹:@buff_ssbu Wario's matchup spread is awful if you disregard Waft, so probably him
🌩 Storm 🌩🏳️‍🌈:@sword_ssb Honestly there's so many good ass characters i keep forgetting they're    mad good and could be like top 15-20 like I forget about Wario and chrom being stupid good alot
