anubis999🕊:@drayden___ pichu and pika aren’t that fun to me and puff is boring, incineroar just doe sn’t fit me 
i think the 4 i play rn are the ones that work w me lol
Dak-O-Lantern:@ddee_ssbu Don’t forget pichu who literally has a bigger head than both of his evolutions
Swampat:@ddee_ssbu Pichu's head is bigger than Pikachu's entire body
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@Phant0mAbat Pichu still dumb af, the only reason I do not fear him as much as I should is because I main his hardest MU
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@Phant0mAbat Rage + high power move + the most sus DI on PICHU Thunder of all moves = death at absurdly early %
ℂ𝕙𝕒𝕞𝕡𝕚𝕠𝕟 𝓕𝓮𝓪𝓻𝓵𝓮𝓼𝓼:@ddee_ssbu I got Pt in Elite and only use Pt, 80% of the cast is bo               ring to me, so I only Play Palu Trainer Joker and Pichu

Xfire:TIL Incineroar has the lowest intangibility frames (1-18) for ledge roll. I thought it was universal like jump or neutral getup...
Plz fix.
Even DDD and freaking DK have the longest intangibility frames besides G&amp;W, Luigi, and Pichu...

Bakubread:@Sanic_SSBU @Spec_DVMN Cloud has two outfits that come with a different sword, Pikachu, Pichu, and Jigglypuff at least get different hats, which are much more distinct than Sonic's tiny little bracelets.
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@CornbreadII @Spec_DVMN You’re telling me that Sonic has th  e worst Alts in Ultimate, despite Cloud, Pikachu, Pichu, &amp; Jigglypuff all existing.
Like seriously, Cloud?!

RoyalMask:@Oofington_SSBU pichu sucks
Karinovirus:@yggdrasil_ssbu @DabuzSenpai Mostly Roy and ZSS being even, and that we beat lucario and gunner. Those last 2 are really fringe so I get it i guess. Also pichu is still pretty bad
Joshi #Taxx2020:RT @radiantFGC: @Joshi_SSBU @YunnyOS I'd say even with Pichu and doable -1 to Pikachu.
GOON | RADIANT:@Joshi_SSBU @YunnyOS I'd say even with Pichu and doable -1 to Pikachu.
Joshi #Taxx2020:@YunnyOS maybe not pichu
Yunny:@Joshi_SSBU Ike looses -2 to pika and pichu

★SOAP | ThanksEVing 🦃🍂★:@FireSoul_38 @StatusQuo_ta @rippleboba Pichu one is a L fine but HSDxD is fine there’s nothing wrong with watching it 🤩
FireSoul:@Ev_SSBU @StatusQuo_ta @rippleboba watching high school dxd
playing Pichu day 1 and dropping him after he got nerfed
Joshi #Taxx2020:kinda what i did with rosa, pichu and fox
MemeChaos; Ex-Plussy:@Oofington_SSBU I'm pretty sure it's Pikachu/Pichu and other combo fighters like that. Not someone like Min Min where you spam smash attacks.
Chris:@JerryTheWhale Its terrible. Notable bad placements.
Chrom Roy Yoshi Falcon Diddy Fox Corrin Pichu Ryu ICs Isabelle Shulk
GRNT | DDee:@ZenkaiM2 Pichu
Jota CTM haz un video sobre Rayman:@YaBoiShy_SSBU YOOO!! POG! I would like the first one but with Pichu, Sonic and Banjo-Kazooie https://t.co/s6H98pEMeD
Toast:@Mak_ssbu loses to pika slightly goes even with pichu
mak:@ToastWtfFTW thoughts on the pika/pichu mu?
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@OriPlant 1 - Infernape
2 - Gliscor
3 - Sobble
4 - Pichu
5 - uhh idk lol but chimchar ig
Buff #IVotedSmash:@IceyRat Give him a bigger hurtbox. At least make it bigger than pichu’s.
Ziller moment deluxe:@Mando_SSBU Villager is a good character but like he is easily our worst matchup no contest and the other losin matchups are characters like pika and Shulk and pichu
kaly:@ddee_ssbu name a pichu that is WWR other than sugmai
🌳STEM🍉🌱:@Mando_SSBU @MaddlyFwip Pichu is literally 2 spots below him lol. Just switch them.
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@MaddlyFwip @stemssbu THERE IS NOW WAY U PLAY VILLY AND
U THINK HES LOW MID LOL
I can see him being worse than pichu corrin and cloud so I just might be biased but he is def Low High on like the BOTTOM side of that imo
🌳STEM🍉🌱:@Mando_SSBU Switch villager and pichu and ness and lucas otherwise you have some based placements

MadlyFwip:@Mando_SSBU Once again as a villager main.
Ain't no way he's in low high in the first place. Much less above Pichu, Corrin, Byleth, Cloud, and many others. I'd place them in mid or high low-mid.
