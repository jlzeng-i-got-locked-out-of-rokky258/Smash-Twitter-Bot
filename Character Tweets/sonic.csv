I'll be really sad at Activision and/or Sakurai if Crash gets in, but didn't include the post-ND games movesets like from the Titans era cause it has more potential to make Crash unique instead making it all classic and generic which Sonic got that problem.

🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@Spec_DVMN @CornbreadII How’s my “everything” Sonic related  ?
Only think on my Twitter that is completely Sonic related is my pfp lmao, but sure, go ahead &amp; assume ALL are like that.🤦‍♂️😭
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@CornbreadII @Spec_DVMN Are you actually here telling me th  at the Grey, Black &amp; Light Blue Sonic Alts are a slight differentiation from the original Sonic Alt, because that’d just point to you being colourblind lmao?
😭😭
Ｓｐｅｃ:@Sanic_SSBU @CornbreadII So whats with sonic mains and making their entire everything sonic related
Bakubread:@Sanic_SSBU @Spec_DVMN "these two completely different outfits for the character are indistinguishable in battle, the pokemon's variety in different colored headgear don't matter because i say so, but Sonic's slight color differences are GOATED" yeah 
ok mr 100% otaku sonic main, you've made your point
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@CornbreadII @Spec_DVMN cannot notice a distinguishable dif  ference between the Light Blue, Grey, Black &amp; Purple Sonic Alts.🤣🤦‍♂️
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@Sonikkujam Where’s the Orange Sonic fur lmao?😂
It’s just a lighter shade of Sonic’s natural fur colour. Imo, Sonic’s better Alts are those that change his fur colour, in tandem with his bracelets &amp; shoe colours.
☃️Nuno☃️:Btw I've tried to learn Sonic since I woke upw sick character
CGN | Yakumo:@Momo_SSBU I still wish to do this mantra because I know how much of an idiot I am. 
I will tell myself that "I suck so bad at this game" even if I loose for example to a Elite Smash Sonic
LeSoS (Forma de Sh!tass):@MandosGalaxy Sonic is bottom 5, more buffs pls 😈
Also, I’ve always asked myself: Why does everyone think Lucario is Mid/Low tier?
Bakubread:@Sanic_SSBU @Spec_DVMN Cloud has two outfits that come with a different sword, Pikachu, Pichu, and Jigglypuff at least get different hats, which are much more distinct than Sonic's tiny little bracelets.

🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@CornbreadII @Spec_DVMN You’re telling me that Sonic has th  e worst Alts in Ultimate, despite Cloud, Pikachu, Pichu, &amp; Jigglypuff all existing.

Nerva:@Just_Say_En That’s the exact reason I hate Luigi tho. You have to play super smart, but if you mess up you’re just dead. Hit his shield unsafely at 50? Dead. Stupid down b to get out of combos. Sonic is all the good of Luigi and he’s super satisfying to 
fight against

How come the Orange Alt, is Purple?!
We have 2 Purple Sonic Alts lmao, like at least the 2 Blue Sonic Alts are noticeably different &amp; well, Sonic’s standard colour is Blue, but with the Purple &amp; Orange Alts, idk what happened?🤷‍♂️

ᗪ尺卂Ꮆㄖ几山ㄖㄥ千 #BLM:@Sanic_SSBU Gray to me is the worst alt costume sonic has IMO while green in this game was massively improved on
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@Spec_DVMN Would you be surprised if I told you that Sm4sh,   for the majority of Sonic’s Alts, where actually pretty good &amp; that Ultimate nerfed a few?
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@NEIN1990 Sm4sh Sonic Yellow Alt, absolutely.
Unfortunately Sonic’s Yellow Alt was nerfed in the transition from Sm4sh to Ultimate. https://t.co/VegepYtn5A
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@curiosityman2 What would you rename the bottom tier to?
Just curious because imo, Sonic’s Purple, Orange, Green &amp; Yellow alts where all better in Sm4sh, however Purple still retained some of its colour on Sonic’s fur in Ultimate, which still gives some credit imo.
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@PowPowSmash @LazyZach23 I generally prefer the alts of Sm4  sh for Sonic, because most of them actually changed Sonic’s fur colour to match his bracelets &amp; shoe colours, which for the Ultimate version of the alt, fail
ed to deliver upon imo.
The actual green fur colour doesn’t really suit Sonic though. https://t.co/jHeUcIfo8G
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:@BeefyPupil My phone was being as dysfunctional as Sonic Sp  in Charge with Rage &amp; wouldn’t let me. Blame my shitty iPhone lmao.😭😭
🏳️‍🌈SonicSpike🏳️‍🌈 #BlackLivesMatter:RT @RIONTM7: 100% true green sonic was better in sm4sh imo
Curiosity Man:@Sanic_SSBU Swap Silver Sonic &amp; Bluer Sonic's placements, move Purple Sonic down a Tier (also said Teir wouldbw renamed), and that's my list.

Drayden the Biker Dragon:- The LEGO games improved when they added voice acting
- Sonic Forces is a genuine masterpiece, and Sonic Unleashed is average at best
- Switch Pro Controller is the best controller (alongside the GC one)
