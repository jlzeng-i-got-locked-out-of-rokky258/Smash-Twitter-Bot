LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@U5agi_Mari Snake ditto? 😳
Bandits | 0mart 🇩🇴:https://t.co/JYyR3TKx1G Can someone explain me why there are some instances whe  re the nade doesn't explode when you hit it with some aerials? I know that trascendent or "beam" related moves always explode it but don't know about physical based like swords. @Ruben_dal  #SSBU_Snake
Sharlion:@UnluckySummer0 @Krosshair_SSBU Snake has one of the best Down Tilts in the game and nobody talks about it
Sharlion:@Krosshair_SSBU But spamming Dash Attack as Snake IS neutral
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:You do not have an aggressive Snake, please stop spamming dash attack and play neutral
(totally NOT a self-subtweet 🙂) https://t.co/5vIhPJrYIg
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@Ronnichu_ Trust me I’d be playing Snake AND Banjo if I had the dexterity to do all of his crazy shit
SOAP | Yuri!:@yggdrasil_ssbu ness has a better up tilt than snake even though ness mains don’t even use that move unless the opponent is at 0%
0-2 PogU:@trislosherz i need someone to tell me how snake is A
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:Alright, here’s a hypothetical for today:
Let’s say patch 9.1.0 drastically alters game mechanics by bringing back DACUS (and the Gatling Combo by extension), perfect pivots, and jab canceling for all characters.
How good is your main now?
Snake becomes top 6 like in Brawl IMO
TFG | Bees?:@missinput Snake Dair OOS with Deep Breathing? That's like 35% on a frame 6 option???

maeger🦧@dark(netflix og):@juniper_snake meaty jab
Masterstarman:@ColeTheRenZ I think Banjo is still my favorite announcement, but that's a huge bias. Most characters set some pretty high bars. Snake, Sonic, Mega Man, Cloud, Ridley, K Rool, Joker,... really most of the SSBU DLC... crazy how all this happened!

anubis999🕊:@LudwigFrog i had thought snake was close to even anyway and i talked to jay about it an d he convinced me otherwise before venia said anything lol
don’t make assumptions in arguments it won’t get u anywhere
HK | LudwigFrog:@anubis999_ssbu And you thought snake was losing until venia tweeted not you all of a sudden change mind LOL
DF1 | Mustang:@ddee_ssbu Otherwise snake maybe
TiBi:@ddee_ssbu Many of those replies not realizing one thing that characters like snake pac that play their own game are those who require less amount of “fundies”... in the other hand, character like Lucina is fundi-heavy
anubis999🕊:@PlayerUnknown_ @King_Venia venia prob knows more but from my exp you basically have to  play out of dash attack burst range w shuriken and full hops then either counter a nade or whiff punish when he gets bored and bairs/dash attacks
you can watch tarik vs MVD at glitch and tarik shows how to outspace snake
𝘾𝙐𝙍𝙎𝙀 ‼️:@ddee_ssbu the characters that essentially play their own game. min min, sonic, snake,      little mac, shit like that. it's not a jib at them either, for example snake plays a different game but that game is still hype and takes a fuck ton of skill   
Octave:@Kp_unicorn Pac cool ✅
Bayo lame ✅
Snake is at the bottom ✅
Not perfect but definitely passable.
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@bonnabellegames Snake
Colin:@BaseBeJay I honestly see Snake the same as i see Shulk both are hype imo but have some really dumb stuff that can make people hate the character.
when it comes to your playstyle i would have to say it does not piss me off so we good
damn i hate the MU :/

LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@ant_ssb Normally I’d be outraged but then I remember that Snake’s hitboxes are even dumber so I have no room to speak lol
Meh Master:@UnluckySummer0 I can help you with the gren snake mu 🤡

🏳️‍⚧️ Princess Yoby 🏳️‍⚧️:@Octave_SSBU Ehh. Not feeling it. I could see an argument for Snake bein  g lame but I don't think he's quite that lame. Then again I don't think anyone is quite that lame. It's possible to hit and miss at the same time
Octave:@PrincessYoby Snake is so lame it makes Sonic look cool.
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@ApolloKage Snake just said “All planned 😎🧠”
Shit looks sick af

SoupaPowa:@ddee_ssbu Personally I like Snake Man, Brainstar Depths, and Gangplank Galleon as my top songs
Dante Edwards:@Mando_SSBU Lucas is not a furry, he's a zoophile.
I really don't wanna know where that fuckin snake comes from
MC | Raffobaffo:@ddee_ssbu Brawl Snake out Rangers fucking marth's sword
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@Phant0mAbat Snake is a fundamentally sound character but it’s when you begin to explore all of his bullshit that you truly begin to understand how to play with all that sauce

drayden:@ddee_ssbu I didn't play Brawl competitively but I'm guessing Snake up tilt was toxic
