Joe (Kars):@Thank_SSB @Octave_SSBU "Resident Falco main, Kars, also approves of this message"
DeltaDark| Sponsored:@ddee_ssbu Greninja is pretty difficult to combo with because of his crazy high jumps, unlike Falco they don‚Äôt really have an easy combo tool to balance that like fair, he has uair but then you have to drift and all that. Just the skill required for Greninja is the issue
A2ZOMG:@KhaosDFW @ddee_ssbu @Kingey11 @AOKoala2014 @FrogboiCy Not even close. It's a super high commitment projectile that wins no stage control uncharged.
It's extremely massively overrated. Falco laser is better.
A2ZOMG:@ddee_ssbu @Kingey11 @KhaosDFW @AOKoala2014 @FrogboiCy Uncharged Water Shuriken is f20 minimum. That's GARBAGE.
It's worse Falco laser and you can literally short hop over it on reaction. Charged versions are only good in advantage state.
SOAP|Oofington:My ideal character is one that
Rushesdown opponents
Has a good projectile like gyro
And is just Fox with Falco dair and bair https://t.co/m3hbco3OKp

RPG || Runaway‚ö°:@Super_SSBU I double dipped AGAINST falco to clutch out a set and no one was there to pop off üòî
Supahotfiyahhh:If you double dip as Falco and no one is there to pop off did you really double dip ?!
Thor:@FingerStripesPM Aw was hoping to see you say you'd give Link Falco's blaster, not the other way around
In PM I legit have no idea who my second best is, so I'll pretend and say Link gets Toon Link's bair
In SSBU Cloud gets... Ganon's... nair?

Buff #IVotedSmash:@M1stful Mario is like 0/+1 vs falco. Falco does better than fox in the mu.
Dylan:@ddee_ssbu @LuigiTKO Once you get the hang of little mac he gets easier i main little Mac, cloud, falco and Pkmn trainer im not the best but I do have  around 30 elite smashers on my secondary account after I got everyone in on my main

MrFaelen:@Bees_ssbu @jonAKAproto @IntroSpecktive Falco's up smash don't even hit him in idle animation
Thor:@TarikGekkouga @legoerofeggos @gg_newb That was a smash 4 mechanic - Luigi could effectively coin spike shotos with it in s4
The timer was reduced in ssbu but idk by how much... could probably lab it with falco blaster or something
Gucci Eyebags:@elitetweet_bird I would but I don't wanna play against Falco tbh
Josh #Taxx2020:@anubis999_ssbu Wario, Fox, arguably falco because he just uptilts out of parry and does 70, GnW depending on the move he parried, and that's just off the top of my head
Yeah I didn't have a point but your phrasing was wild with that bruh
WittyWarbler:@BenedettiTomma1 @ddee_ssbu Not high, mid/low level but at high other people will also play metaknight, or falco, and while mk was utterly insanely broken, he wasn't unbeatable if your opponent was better than you.

Joshi #Taxx2020:@IronyCloud Really?
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I have never died to a falco pre 100%
HL | Irony:@Joshi_SSBU Falco also has kill confirms at 60 - 80, some later than that too
HL | Irony:@Joshi_SSBU Maybe its just me, but I don't think I've been hit by an ike combo that dealt over like 40, as Falco, 40 is a pathetic string, maybe my memory is failing me tho, we can run some games tonight if you care to prove me wrong
Joshi #Taxx2020:@IronyCloud I agree with this but
Falco
Does
More damage
Than Ike https://t.co/ZJ2qGJaLwm
HL | Irony:@Joshi_SSBU Here's what I say about ike, we do significantly more damage than ike does, ike up b, if done to high can be hit by shine, Falco is slightly faster and whiff punishes pretty well vs ike, from my experience, I put it as slightly Falco favor, but its not a giant win by any means
Octave:@Thank_SSB Really good Falco
Really good Falco and a nice person

Buff #IVotedSmash:Mario but with falco jumps
GRNT | DDee:@Foxx_SSB @ixblip Falco‚Äôs is better as an anti air while Steve‚Äôs is a boxing option
So yea it depends
Kate ‚Äúhot woman gf‚Äù .x:@ddee_ssbu @ixblip I think Lucina is questionable but Steve‚Äôs up-tilt is good for low percent combos, is a good anti-air but lacks because he isn‚Äôt very fast, and a character like falco definitely has a better up-tilt because of its larger hotbox and higher combo potential
Me:@ddee_ssbu Definitely. But Falco‚Äôs is still pretty insane
Me:@ddee_ssbu Where does ultimate falco‚Äôs fall on the list?
GRNT | DDee:@boltergeist3000 How is falco‚Äôs better
üÖ±Ô∏èoltergeist-3000:@ddee_ssbu Falco has a just as good(maybe better) up tilt as steve imo
BigDJShag:@ddee_ssbu What about falco?

HL | Irony:@ddee_ssbu Falco optimally is a whiff punish character, harder to do online technically
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@EldraziM WHAT?
Pac is honestly borderline top tier and falco
i can see that but there is no way u think pac is low high
Sky:@Thank_SSB @Octave_SSBU Thank I know you are a falco main and all but you dont have to ALWAYS be a wingman for your friends you know üòâ
Jaibm'n:@Mando_SSBU @Cutter_FGC Ness just has better moves, sure Lucas has potential and can have a combo game better than Falco but unless they make it so you don't have to be an actual gamer god to pull off his big combo's he'll be mid forever, with exceptional players. Like Pikachu in Melee and Axe
S0rce:@Mando_SSBU mid tier
her moveset is all arround good
her dair and pound are really good
and falco IS high tier his advantage state + combos are really good up throw is way to good and uptilt
you can do upthrow fair drag down upthrow up and upair upair etc
S0rce:@Mando_SSBU puff is not low tier
falco is high tier
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@BentTfg U have a very weird top 5 ;-;
Ridley Plant yoshi Joker Peach Mario and definitely greninja are to low
chrom should be next to roy
Snake and zss arnt top 5
Cloud Olimar Falco Zelda Yink are 2 high
there are a few other nitpicks but
its a decent list
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@Lucky38ssb Isabelle I can but I just
dont lol
Falco isnt ordered but hes still upper mid imo
SOAP | SOAP:@Mando_SSBU Lucas better than ness
Sonic in top
Cloud worse than wii fit
Ken above ryu
Terry worse than both of them
Robin in low mid
Luigi and falco same tier as ridley
Bayonetta better than JR
MK borderline bottom tier?
DK is in no ways worse than Incin, and more of a mid character (1/?)
Lucky 38:@Mando_SSBU Shulk and wario and sonic way too high especially sonic
Pac and especially megaman too low
Ryu and ken being adjacent is woke and big brain
Cloud should go up and so should ness
ICs are literally bottom 3
Isabelle is WAY better than that and so is Falco
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®
Rosalina üò≥:@Mando_SSBU Move Falco up to the bottom of high tier
After that, then I'm a happy camper
