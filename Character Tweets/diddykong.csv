Diddy Kong (#36):ooc 
Changed up my username bit match up my profile my Twitter header is temporarily for now of Diddy's introduction from SSBU
Had choose Diddy Kong he was my very first favorite video game character 20 years ago still is
Syndrome:@LANKingGaming Probably fox or diddy?
„ÄåZeNMa„Äç:RT @JamesRodgers25: Normal ftilt vs down angled ftilt in the same position. Even though down angled reaches lower, regular ftilt is still b‚Ä¶
SPDQ|-mamaco:@xolotltolox @sailor_snow_ @ddee_ssbu Diddy kong barrel yoshi egg confirms also anything that is techinical in my eyes deserves at least a bit of reconigtion
Monkey?:@monkygpg I think you should swap the fair instead. Diddy bair is too stupid in combos, and his fair is a lot slower then Palu‚Äôs

Jodgers:Normal ftilt vs down angled ftilt in the same position. Even though down angled reaches lower, regular ftilt is still better for 2 frames most of the time. It's hard to know when to know why one will work better, so just experiment.

SyC | Pablo:11- Diddy Kong https://t.co/gTq67YDVvI
The Gingerbreadman:@ddee_ssbu @RikuPlayz_ @PrecedeSmash Not hype. I do consider the diddy infinite and isawobble hype. This is sad. And this is eaaasy, I think that‚Äôs uncontroversial. Luigi combo takes more skill.
steamy:@ShotgunSsbu his diddy is so fun to watch, he's a really tech heavy player so its cool to see all these niche diddy techs get used
steamy:@ShotgunSsbu im doing the same thing lol, trying to learn diddy and have been watching a TON of Dakpo
Arcana:@steamy_ssbu well as of now im trying to learn diddy, one thing that really helped me was watching dakpo play. watching high/top level players of the character you want to learn is pretty helpful, it gives you a basic understanding of your options in neutral, as well as advantage/disadvantage

SPDQ|-mamaco:@ddee_ssbu Explanation on the diddy mu?
SSF | Capi de Capit√°n:@Keen_herrera Diddy
blue;pickman:@Mercury_SSB @ddee_ssbu Building makes the matchup a LOT harder for diddy
Mercury:@ddee_ssbu Diddy Kong loses to Steve? I thought it would at least be even
HK | LudwigFrog:@Mando_SSBU You mean losing? Then diddy who is upper mid tier.
Zespeon Adventure DX:@MickleChrom @buff_ssbu Actually reasonable. Why wolf? Diddy I could maybe see, Idk about you but Sonic beats her +1 shes too floaty, slow, cant edgeguard as much, and get screwed by regular sonic stuff.
34+35 ‚ú®üíÖüèæ:@_pla5ma @Mando_SSBU ROB's have better results than diddy and diddy is good ofc but rob is harder to deal w if u ask me
HL | DVG | pla5ma:@kokunutty @Mando_SSBU diddy is better than rob
i misplaced peach
34+35 ‚ú®üíÖüèæ:@_pla5ma @Mando_SSBU i knew this wasn't it when diddy was higher than ROB and peach isnt top tier
Magical Bagel Girl Meowrgan:@thegreyzen ...well for the levels in sse with diddy where he was trying to save dk, it feels kind of.... lost ? but it's very beautiful and still has a real hopeful feeling
i'll always have it set high on jungle japes and kongo falls in ssbu because they remind me of the lake/the swamp !
Kenny Pelphrey:@ddee_ssbu Diddy is so buffed on wifi i love it
