Ziller moment deluxe:@ddee_ssbu @DarkenedYosho @honienut Lucas up smash has a good angle and can kill well smh
PhilZ:@YaBoiShy_SSBU I would like something similar to the 4th banner, but with Lucas (Skin 7)
Disable:RT @IncomeTaxxx: Growing up is realizing that Lucas PK fire is an infinitely more severe war crime than Ness PK fire.
☃️Nuno☃️:@RollerOverHere Hmmm. In appearance you definitely main Lucas, but in personnality you probably main a kind character like Kirby
Roon:@YaBoiShy_SSBU I want uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my boys Steve, Lucas, Kirby and the female pkmn trainer with an esthetic similar to Persona's and a large soda
btw. Congrats for the 400 followers bro!!!!! you deserve it uwu

Draxonis 🍁:@HKDragons1 @PulseOkay @SSBU_Kovu oh i forgot to do this last night sorry lucas
Dante Edwards:@Mando_SSBU Lucas is not a furry, he's a zoophile.
I really don't wanna know where that fuckin snake comes from
PKC | CutterX3 |Busy November:@Mando_SSBU 😈😈lucas placement confuses me, seems moreso even, his neutral isn't affected by down b or luma imo, and pre patch ftilt rosa was super potent
Coolness0228:@Mando_SSBU Lucas furry??? I have never met 1 Lucas furry ngl
Coolness0228:@Capn_Goos @VioletRyuka @ddee_ssbu Side b is good but it isn't carrying Lucas to victory and it gets very predictable very quickly
Farticlez:@ddee_ssbu Lucas loses some stuff, but PK fire is better. However, I don't think the buffed PK fire is enough to compensate for what's lost
KevKev:@ddee_ssbu Lucas has frame specific tech like DJCZ, but on wifi it becomes much harder
Coolness0228:@ddee_ssbu Our combo game which is already hard to perform gets even harder due to wifi. Lucas can't approach on wifi like at all. DJCZ is instantly nerfed on wifi due to how harder is it to execute plus the frame perfect-ness you need and F-tilt 2 framing gets harder on wifi
Violet:@ddee_ssbu Lucas's already tight combos, tech and movement become even harder with added delay. Not to mention he gets camped hard, which is buffed on wifi.
Jaibm'n:@Mando_SSBU @Cutter_FGC Ness just has better moves, sure Lucas has potential and can have a combo game better than Falco but unless they make it so you don't have to be an actual gamer god to pull off his big combo's he'll be mid forever, with exceptional players. Like Pikachu in Melee and Axe
snook:@Mando_SSBU Probably the best tier list you made, still have bad takes tho, sonic isn't top tier, mario and lumina should be top tier, shiek is low high, ness is better than Lucas, and why is daisy low tier lol
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@Cutter_FGC i just dont find ness
AS good ngl
i think lucas just has more potential
PKC | CutterX3 |Busy November:@Mando_SSBU sorry you can't tell me there is a universe in ult where lucas is better than ness
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@stemssbu i think that part is fair
ness and lucas i just dont see as much potential in ness ngl compared to lucas
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@KiwiSSBU i just dont see as much potential in ness than lucas
kinda fair but new buffs feel good
Fair aswell
There literally interchangeable why did u have to comment on that
imo
I pocket robin so its like eh
uh wym?
fair ngl after seeing replys abt jr
not that much potential
idk ig imo
🌳STEM🍉🌱:@Mando_SSBU Switch villager and pichu and ness and lucas otherwise you have some based placements
SOAP | SOAP:@Mando_SSBU Lucas better than ness
Sonic in top
Cloud worse than wii fit
Ken above ryu
Terry worse than both of them
Robin in low mid
Luigi and falco same tier as ridley
Bayonetta better than JR
MK borderline bottom tier?
DK is in no ways worse than Incin, and more of a mid character (1/?)
P_lague:@pathetic33 @Mando_SSBU Well it’s ok, but some placements are weird like y is sonic top tier and Mario isnt, and y is ness mid when Lucas and Wii fit are high
monke:@StardustYokai @Mando_SSBU explain what is better about lucas
Stardust|🔜 Steve On The PGR:@Mando_SSBU Yeah and since lucas does not get much results we don't have much to go off of but I do honesty think at his full potential he could be high tier but as of now not really and I do agree there is a definitive tier list but like it's really hard to judge.
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@StardustYokai okay
then just say
i think ness is better than lucas
Stardust|🔜 Steve On The PGR:@Mando_SSBU Lucas being better then ness is whack that's why also villy not that good chill out
Stardust|🔜 Steve On The PGR:@Mando_SSBU Cloud and ness should swap with lucas and villager
