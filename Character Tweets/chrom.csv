Sword:@Storm_SSBU_DBFZ Chrom is broken on town in this mu but only if the Chrom is playing well. SV is still the better cp overall tho
Atrocious:@KamuiChrom LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU CAN SO WE CAN DO CHROM V PEACH TO PROVE HOW BAD PEACH IS
Atrocious:@KamuiChrom Because that's true! At least I'm not lying about Chrom who is top 10 ez

Training Arc Sealed:@buff_ssbu Corrin I see +1 man idk I don't play either I see Chrom even on a GOOD day
Buff #IVotedSmash:Corrin and Chrom don’t beat Mario
🍪Aj🍪 (icies❄️):RT @Kimkun06: I friggin finally drew something.

Spektal | Very cool person:@Arashi_SSBU Chrom is bad, #Chromsux.
LeSoS (Forma de Sh!tass):@VGBC_GimR Sonic has a pretty good chance against them, except against Chrom/Roy sometimes...
GRNT | DDee:Challenge: Iron man
next time you go on elite smash try and see how far you can get in an iron man challenge
(Start at Mario, every game you win move to the next character in order, no echoes allowed except chrom, Lucina, and ken)
report results
Buff #IVotedSmash:@IceyRat @LeverSmash Roy doesn’t really outrange us as hard as most swords do and he gets comboed pretty well because he’s tall and falls fast, while being susceptible to mario's edgeguards. Chrom has an even worse recovery than Roy does and doesn’t kill as early.
winter the Menace:@anubis999_ssbu yea but theyll nerf mario and chrom
Pillow:@_HavocSnake_ finally someone who has the correct opinion on chrom
AzLuFa | NRN:Takes I had when I first started playing SSBU that sound like @/LudwigFrog takes :
"Wolf has the best back throw in the game"
"Chrom has the best recovery in the game"
"Sonic is too fast he's not a very good character"
Chris:@JerryTheWhale Its terrible. Notable bad placements.
Chrom Roy Yoshi Falcon Diddy Fox Corrin Pichu Ryu ICs Isabelle Shulk
Jose Matamoros:@SSBU_Martin So do you, Chrom.
AdrianAnt:@ddee_ssbu Chrom/Roy no doubt
All Day Long:@ddee_ssbu Isn’t Roy’s better than Chrom’s? Or is it the same/worse cause I’ve heard a lotta people say Roy’s is
FS | isohel:@MegaWah_SSBU @adiposting chrom is literally the most fake hype character in this game
SOAP|Oofington:RT @GymCoachGG: A naked women can get THOUSANDS of likes, how many likes can my boy Chrom get?😳 https://t.co/y4F8pl2O18
Martin (SSBU) (Team Super Star):Hero: Something is wrong?
WHY I HAVE 2 SELF DESTRUCTS!?!?!?!?!?
Chrom: You have a Sword.
#SmashBros #SmashBrosUltimate #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/iVm7Ov9RMT
VGLS | StarPingu:@buff_ssbu Also Roy does better at killing super early and pressures better in certain situations which is why I think he's slightly better than Chrom imo.
Buff #IVotedSmash:How come mario does well against chroy? I thought his weakness was range? — Roy doesn’t really outrange us as hard as most swords do and he gets combod pretty well because he’s tall and falls fast while Chrom has an even worse rec… https://t.co/zS1HlsaL2T
Epic_NaN #banlylat:@ddee_ssbu defo Chrom/Roy
Ace:@z7duckx Chrom ditto 😳
chris/bore:@ddee_ssbu roy/chrom are tied for first (for different reasons), and its not even close
ℂ𝕙𝕒𝕞𝕡𝕚𝕠𝕟 𝓕𝓮𝓪𝓻𝓵𝓮𝓼𝓼:@drayden___ @ddee_ssbu Technically Chrom because it doesn't have th               e chance of sour spotting.
j:@ddee_ssbu But yeah it’s chrom
Evelyn Pentakill:@ddee_ssbu Depends on how Inkling jab fits. Overall is the best jab in the game because of the ink mechanic in my opinion, but if its just considering FD and these stuff its obviously Chrom / Roy
Jordan Acidera:@Graffiti_ssbu BETTER BE FOR FUN. CHROM PLAYERS ARE DUMB @HiD_Evanger
Jonhy:@insomniacSXUL @anubis999_ssbu tf its gna be chrom 😭
TSK | Silver:@SSBU_Kovu @SSBM_Aghi Don’t make me kick your chrom out of elite smash again
GRNT | DDee:@UncivilNinja Maybe chrom
GRNT | DDee:@MNTO_Mori You would main chrom
Buff #IVotedSmash:@MickleChrom I agree with where mario is 👍
But why is min min bad for chrom
TC | Nathez:RT @Lattie9001: Another one, every move Bowser can TG in Chroy's kit (at least that we know of)! 
And like for all of these videos, please…
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@Phant0mAbat u have the RIGHT characters its just there in the wrong places
also
gnw and chrom
why arnt they up there?
✨Abat:@buff_ssbu He could be but I feel like I just don’t know enough to place him super high and he also feels fairly linear. He’s kinda just chilling directly below with other good characters like Chrom, Fox, Young Link, and GnW solely due to there just being
 so many good characters.
Connor Gritti:@DokuUMR Chrom is more fun
Connor Gritti:Ok I love chrom.
TA | QuiRbo:@tigers_SSBU @The64Ssb Les mains Chrom et DK en sueur. https://t.co/d0xbfDCCk7
Connor Gritti:Might start playing chrom again for fun.
🌩 Storm 🌩🏳️‍🌈:@sword_ssb Honestly there's so many good ass characters i keep forgetting they're    mad good and could be like top 15-20 like I forget about Wario and chrom being stupid good alot
TBZ | VorteX (Comms Open!):@ddee_ssbu chrom
Buff #IVotedSmash:@SSBU_Kovu @LuigiTKO @aFx_Punky i refuse to believe chrom and cloud dont beat gnw
DCLXVI | Merkulon:@ddee_ssbu @sword_ssb I personally put them about even. I feel like Roy's recovery is a little better but unless you hit hilt often then hes kinda jank. Chrom is a little more consistent but his really vertical/linear recovery kinda holds him 
back. Its a toss up personally.
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@BentTfg U have a very weird top 5 ;-;
Ridley Plant yoshi Joker Peach Mario and definitely greninja are to low
chrom should be next to roy
Snake and zss arnt top 5
Cloud Olimar Falco Zelda Yink are 2 high
there are a few other nitpicks but
its a decent list
