anubis999üïä:the reason i now play 4 pok√©mon at a competitive level is cause if i was a trainer irl m y team would be squirtle ivysaur charizard mewtwo greninja and lucario. this is not actually the reason they are all just fun as hell but fr this would be a sick ass team

anubis999üïä:@insomniacSXUL i can maybe take lucario however i am not better than tarik or pandarian
anubis999üïä:@UnluckySummer0 lucario zss might be even tho
0-2 PogU:in what world is plant better than:
bayo CLOUD bowser ness IKE banjo icies pits lucario robin ridley k rool byleth belmonts kirby etc etc https://t.co/A7iRhrgWb9
LeSoS (Forma de Sh!tass):@MandosGalaxy Sonic is bottom 5, more buffs pls üòà
Also, I‚Äôve always asked myself: Why does everyone think Lucario is Mid/Low tier?
LC | Krosshair #BringGoldenSunBack:@SSBU_Z @JustinSamus Who‚Äôs the Lucario, Armadillo?
Z:My only goal today was to avenge @JustinSamus by beating our local Lucario god
I can go back to playing DBZ : Kakarot on my PS5 in 4K now with 3D audio üòå https://t.co/qUGzBRIjkA
Karinovirus:@yggdrasil_ssbu @DabuzSenpai Mostly Roy and ZSS being even, and that we beat lucario and gunner. Those last 2 are really fringe so I get it i guess. Also pichu is still pretty bad
0-2 PogU:RT @LucArmadillo: LUCARIO IS A WHOLE SWORD CHARACTER LMAO https://t.co/4qlIo7GnYT
Dave AKA Omega:@ChallengerPack8 I don't know.  Maybe this could potentially lead into a super smash bros reveal trailer soon, as Lucario and Mewtwo are both in SSBU.
Buff #IVotedSmash:@itsthatdudeok Rosa is even and mario beats byleth and Lucario imo

My Nam Is Jam:@ddee_ssbu @Its_Garou @GodspeedMario I still wouldn't call Steve a gimmick though. Design wise he is gimmicky, but he still has tools like blocks and tnt that are very versatile. He's not like Lucario where he's useless without his gimmick mechanic (for Steve this would be diamond tools) being in effect.

My last update of Aura cues. Aura's scaling improved, so the phases of Aura happens a little earlier in case we didn't know:
KEY
7.0.0 Aura % = 9.0.1 Aura %
Final Aura Visual
92.59% = 89.7X%
FPG Cinematic Zoom-In
95%+ = 91.1%+
Final Aura SFX
117.08576% = 111.6X% https://t.co/TOjoR6ezJX
Animated Mel:3 Stock 18.9% Victory  https://t.co/EvlDpnWQfd Yikes! My Ryu get busy too.... don't sleep! #twitchclips #Ryu #SSBU  #lucario

Question for Lucario players.
What is the most satisfying sound effect you like from Lucario's moves?
Rencario:This kept me going in a tourney tbh wicked risk thinking it can kill so low üòØ #smashultimate #lucario #rencario #pokemontrainer #greninja #smashbros #smashbrosultimate #pokemon #ssbuclips #elitesmash #supersmashbrosultimate #smashbrosclips #ssbu #ssbultimate #smashbrosswitch https://t.co/L1B7trcu6P
Supahotfiyahhh:@isohel_lol @ViriROB But you made me realize that Lucario is still ass even after the buffs so thanks for that
Orb!t ~ Comms Open:@apoeclipse Even our bottom 5 are decent, Lucario is bottom 10-15
anubis999üïä:@ZenkaiM2 @LucArmadillo he‚Äôs at the same place of lucario. top of mid, MYABE low high. o ne change and he‚Äôs high tier FREE

LucarioKing:@ddee_ssbu Lucario is a slow bait and punish character with no range, smash 4 lag on his moves, and an insanely high skill ceiling
not a great fit for how slow wifi is
Bent_801:@10ksmash @Mando_SSBU Lucario (IMO) has potential and sonic because i struggle with him personally.
HL | 10k:@Mando_SSBU @BentTfg The Lucario and Sonic placement???
PLEASEEE CHECK PIN I WANNA DO DOUBLESSSS:@pathetic33 @StardustYokai hes still worse than duck hunt
even my list biased lucario
Stardust|üîú Steve On The PGR:@pathetic33 @Mando_SSBU Not listening to a guy who thinks duck hunt is worse then lucario

No freaking wonder it doesn't matter when Lucario's up a stock at high %. Dang. That's dope https://t.co/uag3o0KOpm
B√´√´p B√™√™p:@Mando_SSBU Results shouldn't mean shit lol
I bet Lucario would at least be high tier if top players played him more often
